Hi!  My name is Samuel (he/him).

<p>
PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES --- I'm allergic to cat dander and oats.

<p>
MEYERS BRIGGS --- here is my whimsical, 12-axis coordinatization of the space of personalities (and where within that space I sit): I like cows more than dogs, counterpoint more than harmony, rhythm more than rhyme, use more than mention, Haskell more than Lisp, honesty more than truth, Joel Kim Booster more than Julio Torres, "spirited away" more than "howl's moving castle", being horizontal more than being vertical, pet snails more than pet fish, co-vectors more than vectors, and analogies more than lists.
But not by much.

<p>
JOB --- I'm a grad student who studies generalization theory in machine learning (I work with Josh Tenenbaum and Greg Wornell). 
NORMAL HOBBIES --- Beyond work, I enjoy cooking simply, watching queer netflix shows (What we do in the shadows!  Unbreakable!  Schitt's Creek!), and trying to expand and refine my sense of flavorspace (e.g. through blind jelly bean classification).  When I have time or on days when my sense of shame at procrastination is dull, I read omnivorously: most recently, I've enjoyed revisiting Ishiguro's melancholy hits, savoring Dawkins' intuition-pump-filled "extended phenotype", and trying to contain my laughter at Hills' "How to Do Things Right: The Revelations of a Fussy Man".   I enjoy all these, but my true addictions are as follows...

<p>
MY OBSESSIONS --- I find immense joy in (badly) singing instrumental (not vocal!) bach and beethoven parts when nobody is around; it's through that that I recently got very interested in composing music using microtones: notes between the notes on a piano!  I find myself constantly starting new small programming projects (a music animator, a timbre synthesizer, a compiler for my programming language "bovine", an svm-based chess engine, etc); completing such projects often feels satisfying and just as often feels like an addiction I should temper down.  Perhaps most of all --- this is my "podcast" topic, the one I bore all my friends' ears off with --- I am passionate about zany constitutional reforms I dream up such as public-key randomized voting.

<p>
SAID WHISTFULLY:
I wish to one day visit the gym.
