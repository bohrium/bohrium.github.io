<h2>  Representation Theory </h2>

<h3>  What are Representations? </h3>
<h4>  Yeah, What are They? </h4>
    A <b>representation</b> of a group $G$ over a field $\FF$ is simply a functor $\rho:G\to\text{Vec}_{\FF}$
    from $G$ to the category of vector spaces over $\FF$.  In other words, a representation is a group
    homormorphism $\rho:G\to \Aut(V)$ from $G$ to the linear automorphisms of some $\FF$ vector space $V$.
    Equivalently, a representation is a module $V$ over the group-ring $\FF[G]$.  
<p>
    Morphisms between representations of $G$ over $\FF$ are then <em>natural transformations</em> between functors,
    linear maps between vector spaces that respect the $G$ action, or homomorphisms of $\FF[G]$ modules.
    Note that a bijective homomorphism is automatically an isomorphism. 
    The category of $\FF[G]$ modules is <em>abelian</em> --- I don't know enough homological algebra
    to really grok what this means, but some of the important facts are that (finitary!) sums and products
    exist and agree; hence, that initial and terminal objects (i.e. zero-ary sums and products) exist and agree;
    and that the familiar isomorphism theorems about abelian groups hold.
    As a concrete illustration: to perform <b>direct sum</b> on representations of a fixed group $G$, just perform
    it on their underlying vector spaces and let $G$ act componentwise.
<p>
    We say that $\rho$ <b>represents $G$</b> or <b>is a representation of $G$ on $V$</b>.  We will often
    abuse terminology by speaking of "the representation $V$", even though $V$ technically lacks
    the information of $\rho$; in doing so, we sin as heinously yet conveniently as when we refer
    to a group by its underlying set.  We thus speak of a representation's <b>dimension</b> and subspaces
    and so forth.
<p>
    For example, if $G$ acts on a set $X$, then this action induces a representation of $G$ on the
    free vector space $\FF^X$.  Concretely, this means that each element
    $g\in G$ maps to a permutation matrix.  Thus, though every vector space is a set (via the
    forgetful functor) and thus representation theory a special case of group action theory, 
    we can also say that, because every set generates a vectorspace (via the free functor), that
    group action theory is a special case of representation theory.  As a special case, if $X=G$
    and $G$ acts on $X$ by left multiplication, then we obtain a representation of $G$ on $\FF^G$:
    the <b>regular representation</b>. 
<p>
    We will focus on the case where $G$ is finite, $\FF=\CC$, and $V$ has finite dimension.
<p>
<h4>  Example: Finite Abelian Groups </h4>
    Not all representations have permutation-matrix form: let $G = \ZZ/n\ZZ$ act on $V=\CC^1$ by
    $\pi_\eta(g)(v) = \eta^g v$, where $\eta$ is an $n$th root of unity.  The corresponding matrices
    have shape 1-by-1 and entry $\eta^g$.  It's easy to show that the 1-dimensional representations
    of $\ZZ/n\ZZ$ correspond bijectively to the $n$ different $n$th roots of unity. 
<p>
    We obtain higher-dimensional representations by direct summing the $\pi_\eta$s.  In fact, all
    finite-dimensional representations of $\ZZ/n\ZZ$ arise this way: 
<p>
    <b>Theorem M</b>:
    <em> Each finite-dimensional representation $\pi:G\to \Aut(V)$ of $G=\ZZ/n\ZZ$ is isomorphic to some $\bigoplus_i \pi_{\eta_i}$. </em> 
<p>
    <b>Proof</b>: 
        If $g\in G$, then $\pi(g)^n=I$ is the identity.  However, Jordan Normal Form shows that this is possible only if
        $\pi(g)$ is diagonalizable.  Moreover, since $G$ is abelian, the $\pi(g)$s all commute.  If a finite set of diagonalizable
        operators all commute, then there exists a basis that simultaneously diagonalizes all of them.
        This basis gives the decomposition we seek.
    (end of Proof)
<p>
    In fact, the proof shows that whenever $G$ is a finite abelian group, then its finite-dimensional
    representations decompose into 1-dimensional representations.  However, since $\Aut(V)=\CC^\star$ is abelian
    when $V$ has dimension $1$, the image of a $\rho:G\to\Aut(V)$ must be abelian, even if $G$ is not abelian,
    whenever $\rho$ is a sum of 1-dimensional representations.  However, the regular representation is an
    injective homomorphism; we conclude that the regular representation of any non-abelian group does
    not decompose into 1-dimensional representations.
<p>
    Let us call representations that are not direct sums <b>irreducible</b>.  We see that when $G$ is abelian,
    every irreducible has dimension $1$.  MORE 
<p>
<h4>  Example: Nonabelian $S_3$ </h4>
    Consider the left-regular representation $V$ of $S_3$.  This has $6$ dimensions.
    by permuting the basis elements.  We see that $V$ decomposes into

<h4>  Irreducible Representations and Maschke's Theorem  </h4>
    If $G$ is a group with irreps $\{W_i\}$, then a representation $V$ is written in <b>Maschke form</b>
    when it is written as $V \cong \bigoplus_i W_i^{\oplus m_i}$ for non-negative naturals $m_i$. 
    representation $V$ is  
    <b>Theorem (Maschke)</b>:
    <em> Every finite-dimensional representation of a finite group $G$ over $\CC$ can be written in Maschke form. </em>
    <em> Moreover, the UNIQUENESS </em>

<h4>  Some Basic Questions and Answers </h4>
    <b>How many irreducible representations does $G$ have?</b> If $G$ is finite, then finitely many;
    this we will see soon.
