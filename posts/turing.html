<h2>  First Definitions in Formal Languages </h2>
<p>
Whereas <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Sipser</span> defines <b>regular</b> and <b>decidable</b> languages algorithmically, this short note
defines the same concepts algebraically. 
<p>
<h3>  Languages as Problems </h3>
<p>
    We can study computation by studying algorithms that classify strings into
    <em>yes</em> and <em>no</em>.
    Since strings form a monoid, they model time and hence a streaming input.
    Many familiar problems reduce to binary classification by means of binary
    encoding.  For instance, we might transform the question
<p>
        <b>How does $n$ factor into primes, where $n$ is the number described in the input string?</b>
<p>
    to the question of
<p>
        <b>What is the $i$th bit of the $j$th prime factor of $n$, where $i, j, n$ are the three numbers described in the input string?</b>
<p>
    So let's fix a finite alphabet $\Sigma$ and let $\Sigma^\star$ denote the free
    monoid it generates.  We then represent a string-classification problem as
    a subset of $\Sigma^\star$ or, equivalently, as a map
    $\mathcal{L}:\Sigma^\star \to 2$. 
<p>
<h3>  Monoids as Computers </h3>
<p>
    The <b>regular languages</b> are those $\mathcal{L}$ that factor as
        $\Sigma^\star \xrightarrow{\epsilon} \mathcal{M} \xrightarrow{\rho} 2$,
    where $\tau$ is a monoid homomorphism and
    $\mathcal{M}$ is a <b>finite</b> monoid.
<p>
    Regular languages are typically defined using finite automata; by
    Caley-embedding $\mathcal{M}$, we see that the algebraic and typical
    definitions are equivalent.
    Our algebraic definition makes clear that the regular languages are closed
    under the usual plethora of operations (such as reversal of strings,
    homomorphic pre-image, and union).
    It also allows a comparison with Turing Decidable languages: 
<p>
    The <b>decidable languages</b> are those $\mathcal{L}$ that factor as
        $\Sigma^\star \xrightarrow{\alpha} (\Sigma \cup \{0\})^\star \xrightarrow{\epsilon} \mathcal{P} \xleftarrow{\supseteq} 2$,
    where $\tau$ is a monoid homomorphism and $\mathcal{P}$ is a
    <b>finitely presented</b> monoid.
    Here, $\alpha$ bookends its input string with fresh symbols $0$ not in the alphabet $\Sigma$
    and we consider $2$ as some subset of $\mathcal{P}$.
    Below, we sketch a proof that this is equivalent to the usual definition.
<p>
    <b>Question</b>: What happens when we replace the condition that $\mathcal{P}$
    be finitely presented by other conditions?  For example, what class of
    languages do we get if we restrict to finitely presented <b>commutative</b>
    monoids?
<p>
    <b>Vague Remark</b>:
    More generally, we are interested in language classes that capture some
    notion of simplicity.  We could call a language class <b>virtuous</b> if it
    satisfied some algebraic conditions.  We would want the regular and
    decidable classes to be virtuous.  It would be cool to state and prove
    that each virtuous class is actually the class of languages computable
    by some appropriate class of monoids.
<p>
<h3>  Proof Sketch  </h3>
<p>
    We will show that if a language is decidable by a Turing Machine, then it
    is decidable in our algebraic sense; the converse and all other remaining
    claims are routine to check.
<p>
    The idea is to have each element of $\mathcal{P}$ represent the state of a
    Turing tape.  The tape symbols (marked with whether or not the tape head
    is on them) generate $\mathcal{P}$, so we only need to find appropriate
    relations.  The transition dynamics of the TM determines several relations     
    of the form $x\dot{y}z \sim x\hat{y}\dot{z}$, where $x, y, z$ are tape
    symbols, $\dot{y}$ denotes that the head is on $y$'s cell, and $y'$ is the
    new value written onto that cell before the head moves to $z$'s cell.
    Two tapes are equivalent (under the equivalence relation generated by these
    string relations) if and only if they lead to some shared future tape under
    the Turing dynamics.  We thus have a finitely presented monoid.
<p>
    Actually, we must deal with initialization and termination, too.
    We use the symbol $0$ concatenated by $\alpha$ to initialize the head location
    and introduce bookending blank tape cells.
    We require the TM to clear its tape before halting, hence ensuring that 
    every accepting trajectory has a unique terminal tape (and likewise for
    rejecting trajectories).
