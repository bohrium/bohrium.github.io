<b>ILLUSTRATION 1</b> --- It suffices to show how to
jointly determine one coinflip, for by repetition this yields enough randomness
to determine an election's outcome.  To jointly determine one coinflip, each
Candidate, prior to election, privately records a sequence of 1000 coinflips,
sealing this record in an envelope to be stored in the public trust.
(Practically, to save an hour of tedium, a trusted computer-saavy team member
does this by computer.)  After election, each Candidate announces their
sequence, and the joint coinflip is be "HEADS" if within the Candidates'
announced sequences together there are an odd number of HEADS --- counting only
those announcements that, as checked against public unsealing of the envelopes,
were faithful.
<p>
<b>ANALYSIS OF ILLUSTRATION 1</b> --- The two key properties are (A) that
any one candidate's choice of sequence can arbitrarily change the joint outcome
and (B) that these choices, and also the voting choices of the People, are not
affected by the choice-of-sequence of other Candidates.  What guarantees (B) is
that the choices were made privately before the election, using the envelopes
as a "commitment scheme" (one also must guarantee that each Candidate's choice
of whether or not to faithfully announce their sequence is not influenced by
other Candidates' announcements, a minor problem within the realm of problems
already solved by current techniques to multiply supervise ballot-counting).
Even if Candidates conspire, so long as some Candidate is not in the
conspiracy, then the latter's fair randomness makes the joint sequence fairly
random.  Moreover, if a Candidate uses any even-somewhat-predictable
sequence-generation method then a conspiracy of competing Candidates could
exploit that predictability to the former Candidates' detriment, so it behooves
the former Candidate to use actual fair randomness.  The system is therefore
robust to large-but-not-unanimous conspiracies.  The analysis is similar for
the case where each Candidate belongs to some conspiracy but no conspiracy
contains all Candidates.  Except by a unanimous conspiracy of candidates, this
system produces fair randomness.
<p>
<b>ILLUSTRATION 2</b> --- we may refine the method to
be more to-the-publicly-verifiably-fair as follows.  Have each Candidate
publicly label their envelope with some "digest" of the private sequence
within.  A "digest" is a message related to the private sequence that does not
reveal the private sequence, but that together with a purported private
sequence can be used to check whether the latter is authentic.  This is akin to
the 17th century habit of scientists to announce anagrams of latin sentences
characterizing their discoveries; this way, they could claim priority without
revealing their ongoing work, for when a priority dispute arises they could
reveal the scrambled sentence.  For many decades we have a plentiful supply of
digest-methods built on the combination of many simple arithmetic operations
into an intractable-to-invert mess.  So by publicly announcing digests, one
allows each member of the public --- if they have pen and paper and a spare
weekend, or if they have a computer and a spare minute --- to verify whether an
announced sequence was faithful.
