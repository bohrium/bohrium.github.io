election, nominate a number of candidates, with any group of more than one
fifth of its legislators duly sworn permitted to nominate one candidate, but

either Chamber on any question shall, at the desire of one fifth of those

shall be re-selected.  Each Chamber shall by simple majority adopt and amend
its Rules.

the General Welfare Clause, or on any but a strictest reasonable construction
of the Interstate Commerce Clause, or on any but a strictest reasonable
construction of the Necessary and Proper Clause, shall be called "expansive",
and an "expansive" Bill shall pass the Senate only with the approval of three
fifths of Senators duly sworn.
<p>
A group of more than two fifths of Senators present may, while voting "Nay",
affix to a Bill a signed argument that the Bill is "expansive".  Thereupon, the
Bill shall become Law only if the President, on the basis of constitutional
text alone and not the public good, believes the argument to be flawed and
signs with the Bill an attestation to and explanation of this belief.  The
Courts of the United States shall prioritize such Laws for judicial review.

which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of
the united states, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof

and the Senate shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of
the United States.  If he approve he shall sign it into Law.
<p>
But if not, he shall return it, with his Objections, to the Senate and the
House, both of which shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal and
proceed to reconsider it.  If after such reconsideration two thirds of both
Chambers approve of the Bill, it shall become a Law.  But either way, the votes
of both Chambers shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the names of the
persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the Journal of each
Chamber respectively.
<p>
If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within fourteen days after
it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a Law, in like manner as
if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its
return, in which case it shall not be a Law.
<p>
Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and
House may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented
