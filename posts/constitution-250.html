<h2>  A Sci-Fi Constitution </h2>
<h5>  2026-01 </h5>
<p>
Below is a fantasy: a re-factoring and bug-fix of the US Constitution.  It is
as much wish fulfillment as it is science-fiction speculation.  The underlying
sci-fi narrative is that this new US Constitution is, by one or many
applications of the current Article 5, sometime in the few years after 2026
ratified.
<p>
Scroll down to <b>Article 0</b> for the good stuff.  Before then are some
extra-textual remarks.
<p>
<h4>  Kinds of Change </h4>
<p>
The changes are roughly of 5 kinds, which arranged from least to most radical are:
<p>
CLERICAL STANDARDIZATION, to bring spelling and grammar and
Capitalization to modern standards;
<p>
ORGANIZATION, to group related provisions under titled sections and to remove
provisions no longer in effect;<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160for instance, integrating amendments
into the body, and deleting provisions whose sole purpose was to protect Slavery</span></span>
<p>
CODIFICATION, to license or mandate, in text, structual conventions already
deeply in place but not written in the old-and-actual Constitution;<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160e.g. the practice of
judicial review, or the incorporation to the States of parts of the Bill of
Rights</span></span>
<p>
DISAMBIGUATION, to supply concrete procedure for those exceptional cases where
no procedure is written;<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160such as who
can suspend habeas corpus, or how a State may legally secede, or by what method
delegates to a constitutional convention shall be elected</span></span>
<p>
MODIFICATION, to create new provisions, or to remove old ones, in a local
manner so as to adhere to the global framework of the old-and-actual Constitution.
<p>
Of course, even clerical and organizational changes alter meaning: an abstract
noun may carry different force depending on its Capitalization; an old spelling
emphasizes different aspects of etymology, entangles differently in the Web of
words;<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160insure Tranquility vs ensure Tranquility</span></span> provisions now inactive may,
by negative information or by parallel, help scope and structure active ones;
and provisions gain meaning from their groupings and headings.  An interpreter
both historically informed and committed to public textual meaning would, after
this new Constitution be ratified, have to somehow ascertain how much of that
public textual meaning contains a modern understanding of the historical
meaning.  So even these most minor changes have content.
<p>
Conversely, I argue that even the proposed modifications and disambiguations
amount to small alterations of structure.  I and probably most who think
about constitutional design enjoy, when in whimsical mood, the improvisation of
far-reaching changes to structure or to liberties<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160CHANGES TO STRUCTURE: such
as a diffraction of the Presidency into several elected offices; or a relative
empowerment-or-disempowerment of the Senate in the legislative process; or
permission for some executive departments to be by law insulated from the
President's control; or an explicit supervision process of the States over the
selection of federal Judges; etc, etc.  CHANGES TO LIBERTIES: such as
unqualified textual protections of, or prohibitions against, guns and abortions
and liquor and deficit and suffrage-for-felons</span></span> that one sincerely believes
would benefit the People.  But the point of this exercise is to craft a
revision of plausibly very broad appeal, not to act as benevolent dictator:
today we play a game of moderation.  Even the more major changes are, for this
reason, in essence conservative.
<p>
Having remarked above on form and purpose, I turn now to content.  The more
major changes mainly concern three ideas: stronger BICAMERALISM, the closing of
LOOPHOLES, and the undermining of those old incentives toward FACTIONALISM.  I
remark on each in turn...
<p>
ELEGANCE TODO
<p>
<h4>  Stronger Bicameralism </h4>
<p>
We Americans<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160except Ben Franklin and Nebraskans in their eccentric wisdom</span></span>
celebrate our bicameral system.  When working at its best, it protects
individual rights by requiring broad national consensus before allowing our
out-of-state neighbors from disabling the old rules that protect us, or from
making new rules we have to follow.  The measure of broad consensus is whether
three different bodies (House, Senate, President) --- elected in three
different manners on three different timescales according to three different
spatial slicings-up of the country --- ALL agree that a proposed change helps
more than harms.
<p>
To enhance this requirement of consensus, we might lean into the individual
characters of the Congress's two Chambers.  The ideal fairy tale goes like
this: the House is a hot melting pot of diverse and zany passions, the stage
for the People's grand polyphony; the Senate, a cool deliberator where even the
less powerful States can claim a voice.  I propose to strengthen bicameralism
by making the fairy tale a bit more true.
<p>
<h5>  The Senate </h5>
<p>
The 17th Amendment was proposed and ratified in response to rampant corruption:
State legislators in essence put Senate seats for sale.  But the 17th
Amendment's spirit, one of anti-corruption-via-popular-vote, can be preserved
while also enhancing protections of local democracy: simply allow the State
legislators to prepare the menu of Candidates from which the People choose.
Two desiderata: (A) even a lopsided legislature should produce a diverse menu,
and (B) even if a majority of legislators are bribable and bribed, the menu
should contain one or more "clean" Candidates.
<p>
We kill two birds by letting minority groups of legislators nominate
candidates.  Let any group of, say, 1/5 of the State legislators<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160The original
Article I gives precedent for the U.S.  Constitution breaking encapsulation to
depend on the membership structure of individual State Legislatures.</span></span> nominate
one Candidate, with no one belonging to multiple groups.  Then the People by
<b>single transferable vote</b><sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160In this system, each voter ranks one or more
Candidates (1st, 2nd, etc).  We'll do steps of elimination, so as useful
shorthand let's say a Candidate is at some step a voter's "favorite" when the
voter ranks the Candidate as best among un-eliminated Candidates.  The system
is: SO LONG AS MULTIPLE CANDIDATES REMAIN, ELIMINATE THE CANDIDATE WHO IS THE
FEWEST VOTERS' FAVORITE.  (The remaining Candidate wins.)  Crucially, though
candidates are eliminated, ballots are not: if my first choice got eliminated,
then my ballot still matters in favoring my second choice over my third choice
etc.</span></span> select a winner.
<p>
Under a two party system, unless a legislature is 80-percent Blue or 80-percent
Red, there will be at least one candidate from each major party.  In fact,
since SingleTransferableVote does not have major "spoiler" effects, we expect 4
candidates.  Say a State's pro-Banana caucus, which originally would have
nominated a certain pro-Banana candidate (who peels from the stem), is big
enough that by splitting it could nominate two candidates.  The half of those
pro-Banana legislators who are sympathetic to a different pro-Banana candidate
(who peels from the tip) would not jeopardize the pro-Banana cause if they
split off to nominate that candidate; so we'd get two meaningfully different
pro-Banana candidates.
Legislators who want to avoid appearing complicit in narrowing voters' choices
to just 2 --- a complaint apparently common among voters both Red and Blue ---
and legislators whose ideas and emphases differ, even slightly, from the exact
median preference of their party --- would be incentivized to increase the menu
size.  For this reason, there'd typically be 4 Candidates.
<p>
Moreover, the SingleTransferableVote tends to reward moderation and civility.
Mudslinging toward another candidate has the cost of worsening one's ranking on
the ballots of those who like that candidate.  Say the anti-Bananas are
sufficiently more popular than the pro-Bananas so that it is a given that an
anti-Banana will win; if the anti-Bananas are divided between one extreme and
one moderate candidate, then the pro-Banana voters' rankings will tip the
balance in favor of the moderate candidate.  Result: a moderate anti-Banana
candidate.
<p>
As for bribery: under the original Article I, a mere majority of (upper house)
legislators could sell Senate seats; but in the typical multiple-groups
scenario, unless 4/5ths of the legislators succumb to bribery, the people would
have at least one "clean" Candidate to choose.  And since such bribery when it
happens would be less effective, it would probably happen less to begin with.
<p>
The proposed change, in line with the 17th Amendment, has the People choose
their Senator; moreover, the choice would, under our current two-party system,
have the richness of primary elections in addition to general elections.  The
key difference is that it is subgroups of State legislators, rather than the
local branches (and the primaries they have so much power over) of naion-wide
Parties with national platforms, that select the menu.  Thus, these candidates
would tend to be more sympathetic to effecting the policies of the People ---
whether these be Blue or Red policies --- via State government rather than
National government.
<p>
The 1/5 threshold could have been any smallish fraction.  I chose it for
aesthetic unity.  For, the smallest constant fraction that the old-and-actual
Constitution mentions is 1/5: a minority of Senators or Representatives of that
size may force the presentation (through their respective Chamber's journal) of
information to the People.  This lax threshold for information-flow to the
People resonates with the proposed process by which State legislators recommend
candidates to the People.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h5>  The House </h5>
<p>
To amplify the House's direct and fiery character, one would want a voting
system that <b>FIXES GERRYMANDERING</b>, and, more strongly, that is
Concentration-Unswayed, i.e., that represents each minority no matter their
geographic concentration.  To illustrate, imagine two worlds: in World A, one
third of all districts are entirely Star-Bellied, and the remaining districts
are entirely Plain-Bellied.  In World B, every single district is one-third
Star-Bellied and two-thirds Plain-Bellied.  The Star-Bellies should, of course,
have one third of the House in World A.  What I mean by Concentration-Unswayed
is that the Star-Bellies should enjoy the same House representation in the two
worlds.  A Concentration-Unswayed voting system would, because it is impervious
to gerrymandering and for other reasons, amplify the House's ideal character.
<p>
Yet, of the many Concentration-Unswayed voting systems, the better-known ones
tend to rely on non-local representation.  But Local representation is our
American way.  Your Representative's job<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160unless you're in Puerto Rico or D.C.
or a minor Territory; I'm sorry.</span></span> is to represent you whether or not you voted
for them, and likewise for all in your neighborhood.  This softly rules out
voting systems that enlarge our (already large) districts into multi-member
districts or that, folding in our centuries-long resistance against pure
factionalism, recognize Parties rather than People as the fundamental electable
unit.<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160One could maintain locality for these methods by radically enlarging or
time-splitting the House or by complicated methods whereby local candidates
affiliate with national parties that in turn rank their affiliates, so that,
earning by global vote a budget of seats, their ranking and budget together
determine which of their affiliates win --- hence the word "softly".</span></span>
<p>
So, to get a Concentration-Unswayed, Local voting system seems to require some
<b>TURN-TAKING</b>: I, Star-Bellied, agree with my two Plain-Bellied neighbors that
I will get my candidate this election and they will get theirs in the next two.
Making a table of who agrees with whom, we schedule which subgroups control
which of the next several elections.  Now, this is horribly complicated,
especially as folks move within and between States; worse --- and this is a
fundamental flaw if we seek democracy --- this remember-a-past-table method
does not accomodate people who over time change their mind!  We seek a system
that is Memoryless.
<p>
Fortunately, there is a way out --- a very simple system that is simultaneously
Concentration-Unswayed, Local, and Memoryless.  In this system, the lifetime
experience of a citizen (one engaged enough to vote) in their more than two
dozen House elections, would be, if, say, they happen to be always in a
minority of size one-third, that in close to one third of those elections their
favored candidate wins.  If half of the time they are in a minority of
size-one-third minority and the other half in a size-two-thirds majority, then
in close to half of their lifetime elections their favorite candidate will win.
And so forth.
<p>
The system is this: select each election's winner with probability
<em>proportional to votes received</em>, that is, randomly.  With dice as our
turn-taking mechanism, no memory is needed.  (We, unlike 250 years ago, are a
numerate nation.  To the worry that "Whoever controls the dice controls the
outcome" we may answer that the metaphorical die roll shall be the joint
responsibility of the election's Candidates, by any<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160
<a href="./random-voting.html">Click here for a gentle introduction to the relevant arithmetic ideas</a>.</span></span> of the many methods of randomness-aggregation,
relying on basic arithmetic, that are not just fair but in fact
<b>to-the-public-verifiably fair</b>.  I speak of replicable (for ballot recounts)
and TODO)
<p>
It would be understandable if one feels anxious about turn-taking.  Something
feels <em>unfair</em> about a 60-percent majority getting their way only 60-percent of
the time, and in particular perhaps not getting their way this year!  Here
again, the facilitation via randomness of turn-taking establishes formal
properties to assuage our worry.  Key is that turns are uncorrelated between
distinct districts.  Switching viewpoint from that of single voters across all
their years to that of single years across all their voters, we see by "Laws of
Large Numbers" that the House in every year will have nearly proportional
representation.  How nearly?  Say that about 50-percent of voters<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160weighted, as
usual, by voter engagement and by the ratio of each State's seats in the House
to its population</span></span> vote for the Star-Bellied cause.  Then we expect with
probability 95-percent (i.e., with exceptions only every forty years) less than
4.7 percentage-points of deviation from this quantity.
For comparison, this once-in-forty-year deviation under the turn-taking system
is a bit smaller than the current system's typical deviation of 6.3
percentage-points over the past 20
years.<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160"6.3 percentage-points" is a root-mean-square, over 10 elections, of
the difference between national House representation fractions and national
voting fractions, and counting only the two major parties.  Our computation of
national voting fraction differs from a simple national sum-of-votes in two
ways: (a) we normalize away voter engagement, so a district has the same weight
whether its voters submitted 1000 or 100000 ballots, and (b) each district has
the same weight; e.g.  Delaware-at-large (population 1.0 million) and
Wyoming-at-large (population 0.6 million) both have weight one.  We count
candidates who officially affiliate with Democrats or Republicans, and no
others.  When an election has multiple candidates of the same party, we sum their votes.
We merge all parties with "Democrat" in their name (e.g. Minnesota's DFL), and
analogously with "Republican" (no party counts as both).  I used

<a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/data">the MIT election lab's data</a>.</span></span>
<p>
We could eliminate very unpopular candidates by imposing a threshold before
consideration for turn-taking.  This may assuage fears of some Horrible Fascist
Minority gaining a few seats among the House's many hundreds.  Such fear is the
typical anti-populist fear that is the bass line to the praise, which Blue
voters give during Red eras and Red voters give during Blue eras, of indirect
democracy with checks and balances.  And indeed, not just the moat between "few
seats" and "a majority of seats" but also our bicameral system (the House by
itself cannot make law) give strong answer to the fear.  Still, requiring a low
threshold does little to erode the benefits listed and may calm the anxious
mind.  So we pick a fraction --- as in our discussion of the Senate, 1/5 has
among various small fractions the benefit of aesthetic unity.  Another way it
phrase it is: if your candidate is so unpopular that it'd take longer on
average than the time between censuses for their turn to come, then they are
too unpopular to be considered.  This is because 5 House elections occur
between consecutive censuses.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h5>  Overall </h5>
<p>
Zooming out to our Bicameral theme: each seat of the House is a stage for
expression, not wise consensus.  We further this ideal via
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">MemorylessTurnTaking</span>, which fixes gerrymandering, and due to LawOfLargeNumbers
faithfully reflects the electorate's makeup, and gives voice to minorities ---
those we strongly agree with and those we strongly disagree with.  Meanwhile,
the Senate is the great moderator.  We further this ideal by <span style="font-variant: small-caps">GroupNomination</span>
and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">SingleTransferableVote</span>, the first installing a subtle moderating force
toward State autonomy and the second a mechanism that helps moderate candidates
--- those that unexcitingly unite supermajorities rather than intensely dazzle
mere pluralities --- to win.
<p>
This pair of changes to how Representatives and Senators are elected has the
pleasant property of political balance, for, as I gather, proportional House
representation is considered a Blue cause, and State influence over the Senate
a Red one.  (Aside: to be honest, I don't understand why.  Gerrymandering<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160by
which e.g. Maryland has hurt Red voters and North Carolina has hurt Blue
voters, such effects

<a href="https://isps.yale.edu/news/blog/2023/06/partisan-gerrymandering-mostly-cancels-out-at-national-level-study-shows">by some metrics roughly canceling nationally</a></span></span> hurts both
Blue and Red voters and, more importantly, should offend the republican
sensibilities of every American.  As for the Senate as protector of local
democratic self-government: #among the small States there are both many Blue
and many Red States and, more importantly, the erosion of the power of States
to self-regulate<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160e.g. Blue voters may object that 2005's PLCAA enfeebles local
democratic regulation of guns, or that judges confirmed by a modern Senate may,
in interpreting the Comstock Act, prevent local democratic processes from
ensuring abortion pill access; meanwhile, Red voters may object that 2010's ACA
disables local democratic processes from determining how to balance the health
of children against other costly projects</span></span> has in this century been negatively
felt and much protested by both the Red and the Blue.)

the SUBPOENA power, is "implicit" in the old Constitution.</span></span>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>RULES</b> --- Each Chamber may determine the rules of its proceedings, and punish
its members for disorderly behavior
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>LEADERS</b> --- The three Leaders of each Chamber shall by uniform monthly
rotation take turns to preside over the Chamber and <em>a fortiori</em> to schedule
the Chamber's business,
<p>
Each Chamber shall from its members choose its three Leaders by
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Group Selection</span>, as follows.  Any group of more than one fourth of the
Chamber's members duly sworn may choose one Leader, and no member shall belong
to more than one such group.  Upon vacancy among the Leaders, or with the
signatures of a majority of the Chamber's members duly sworn, the three Leaders
shall be re-selected.  Each Chamber shall by simple majority adopt and amend
its Rules.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE</b> --- But the Vice President shall, when present in the
Senate Chamber, preside over the Senate.  The Vice President shall break ties
when the Senators be evenly divided.  
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>COMPENSATION</b> --- The Senators and Representatives shall receive a
compensation for their services, as Congress shall ascertain by law.  But no
law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and
Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall
have intervened.  And no Senator or Representative shall, during the time for
which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of
the United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof
shall have been increased during such time.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h4>  Acts of Congress </h4>
<p>
<p>
<b>BICAMERAL PASSAGE</b> --- An Act of Congress --- whether bill, order, resolution,
or vote --- shall, unless otherwise stated by this Constitution, require both
simple majority of Representatives present and a simple majority<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160But see
FILIBUSTER paragraphs below.</span></span> of Senators present.
<p>
All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House; but the Senate may
propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.
<p>
<b>PRESIDENTIAL VETO</b> --- Questions of adjournment of the Congress, or questions
requiring the concurrence of one Chamber alone (and not of the President),
shall upon the required votes in Congress take effect.
<p>
But every other Act of Congress shall,<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160This Constitution nowhere
requires "2/3 of each Chamber and the President's approval" or (besides
adjournment) "approval of each Chamber but not the
President".  These extra -stringent or -lax forms
one might want for critical parameters (e.g. to prevent Court-packing or to prevent biasing of Amendment-ratification via State-splitting) or for "mere" procedure (e.g.
adjournment).  With no such forms, we need not refine the phrase "every other Act".</span></span>  before it take effect, be presented to the President of the
United States.  If he approve it, he shall sign it and the Act shall take
effect.
<p>
But if not, he shall return the Act, with his objections, to the Senate and the
House, both of which shall enter the objections at large on their journal and
proceed to reconsider it.  If after such reconsideration two thirds of both
Chambers approve of the Act, it shall take effect.  But either way, the votes
of both Chambers shall be determined by "yeas" and "nays", and the names of the
persons voting for and against the Act shall be entered on the journal of each
Chamber respectively.
<p>
If such Act shall not be returned by the President within 12 days<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160equivalent to
10 days excluding Sundays</span></span> after it shall have been presented to him, the same
shall take effect, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress
by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case the Act shall not take
effect.
<p>
<b>FILIBUSTER</b> --- An Act of Congress whose constitutionality relies on the
General Welfare Clause, or on any but a strictest reasonable construction of
the Interstate Commerce Clause, or on any but a strictest reasonable
construction of the Necessary and Proper Clause, shall be called "expansive",
and an "expansive" act shall pass the Senate only with the approval of three
fifths of Senators duly sworn.
<p>
A group of more than two fifths of Senators present may, while voting "Nay",
affix to an Act a signed argument that that act is "expansive".  Thereupon, the
act shall take effect only if the President, on the basis of constitutional
text alone and not the public good, believes the argument to be flawed and
signs with the Act an attestation to and explanation of this belief.  The
Courts of the United States shall prioritize such laws for judicial review.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h4>  Powers of the Congress </h4>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ENUMERATED POWERS</b> --- The Congress shall have power:
<p>
To provide for the general Welfare of the United States;
<p>
To regulate Commerce among the several States, and with Foreign Powers and the
Indian Tribes; but the transportation or importation into any State, Territory,

respectively the appointment of Officers and the authority of training the
militia according to a discipline the Congress shall be law prescribe;

square) that shall by cession of particular States and the acceptance of
Congress become the seat of government of the United States;
<p>
To define the executive Departments, whose purpose shall be to execute the laws
of the United States, and to define their hierarchy of Officers, with each
Department having one principal Officer; and
<p>
To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into

Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or
Officer thereof.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>IMPEACHMENT</b> --- The House shall, have sole power to impeach, and shall do so
by simple majority.  The Senate shall have sole power to try all Impeachments;
when sitting for this purpose, each Senator shall be on Oath or Affirmation.
When the President or Vice President is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.
And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of
Senators present.
<p>
Judgement in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from
Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, trust, or
profit under the United States; but the party convicted shall nevertheless be
liabla and subject to indictment, trial, judgement, and punishment, according
to law.
<p>
The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States
shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for and Conviction of: Treason,
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors, or for permanent inability to
discharge the powers and duties of their Office.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h3>  Article 2 </h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The executive power of the United States shall be vested in the President.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h4>  Selection </h4>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>STRUCTURE AND TERMS</b> --- The President and Vice President shall be elected, in
November of each fourth year, to a term of 4 years that shall begin at noon on
the 20th day of the following January.
<p>
No person shall be President or Acting President for more than 10 years.  No
person shall be elected President or Vice President, unless they shall, at the
start of the term for which they shall have been elected, have attained 35
years of age.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ELECTION</b> --- The People shall elect the President and Vice President by
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Hierarchical Approval Voting</span>,<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160In plain approval voting, each person
votes for one or more Candidates, and whichever Candidate gets most votes wins.
Approval voting is the most natural and simple voting system I know: a voter
considers each Candidate and answers "yes" or "no".  Our currently standard
system of "select-one plurality voting" is a variant of approval voting where
each voter is constrained to say "yes" at most once; this constraint leads to
severe "spoiler" effects that disincentivize the People from forming diverse
sets of parties.  Instead of compromising coalitions forming by constitutional
means, topic-by-topic, within Congress, they are formed by the vagaries of two
big extra-constitutional organizations.</span></span>
as follows.  Candidates shall run in
pairwise-disjoint Groups of at least three.  Each Voter shall select one or
more Groups and one or more Candidates.  The Group with most votes shall win;
within the winning Group, the Candidate with most votes shall become President
and the Candidate with the second most votes shall become Vice President.
<p>
In these elections, a voter from a State entitled \(R\) many Representatives,
or from the incorporated Territories that as a whole are entitled \(R\) many
Representatives, shall be counted with weight \(1+2/R\).
<p>
No Group in the election shall contain multiple Candidates from the same State.
Each Candidate in a Group shall be a Citizen of the United States and shall by
the time of Inauguration have attained at least thirty five years.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SUCCESSION</b> --- The Legislature of each State shall by law determine a method
by which, based only on the presidential votes of the people of that State and
on the recommendations of the Candidates, a slate of Emergency Electors --- as
many as the State is entitled Senators and Representatives --- is selected.
<p>
Should the role of President Elect become vacant, the Vice President Elect
shall become President Elect; but if the roles become both vacant, then the
Emergency Electors shall all convene to select, by a method of voting as the
Congress shall by law provide, a President Elect.
<p>
Should the role of Vice President Elect become vacant, the President Elect
shall appoint a Vice President with the consent of both Chambers of Congress.
<p>
Should the Presidency be vacated, the Vice President if any shall become
President; but if both Offices be vacant, then a principal Officer of an
executive Department shall become President, according to an order of
succession as the Congress shall by law provide.
<p>
Should the Vice Presidency be vacated, the President shall appoint a Vice
President with the consent of both Chambers of Congress; and until then a
principal Officer of an executive Department, according to an order of
succession as the Congress shall by law provide, shall be Acting Vice
President.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>INCAPACITY</b> --- In the following two paragraphs, "to declare formally" shall
mean "to transmit to the President and Vice President and the Leaders of the
Senate and House a written Declaration"; and "to be incapacitated" shall mean
"to be unable to discharge the powers and duties of the Presidency".
<p>
When the President, or the Vice President with the assent of a majority of
principal Officers of the executive Departments, declares formally that the
President is incapacitated, the Vice President shall become Acting President.
Thereafter, when the President declares formally that he is not incapacitated,
the President shall resume the powers and duties of the Presidency.
<p>
But if in response to the President's latter declaration the Vice President,
with the assent of a majority of principal Officers, declares formally that the
President is incapacitated, the Congress shall, within 21 days after receipt of
the Vice President's latter Declaration, decide the issue: if two thirds of
each Chamber determines the President to be incapacitated, the President shall
be removed from Office; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and
duties of the Presidency.
<p>
<p>
<h4>  Procedure </h4>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>COMPENSATION</b> --- The President and Vice President shall, at stated times,
receive for their services a compensation, which shall neither be increased

they shall not received within that period any other emolument from the United
States or any of them.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>INFORMING CONGRESS</b> --- The President shall from time to time give to the
Congress information on the State of the Union, and recommend to their

<p>
<b>FAITHFULLY EXECUTE</b> --- The President shall take care to faithfully execute
the Laws of the United States.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>APPOINTMENT TO EXECUTIVE OFFICES</b> --- The President shall, with the advice and

<p>
Each inferior Officer of the executive Departments shall be appointed EITHER by
the President with the advice and consent of a simple majority of the Senate,
OR by the Department's principal Officer, OR for a repeatable term of no longer
than 7 years by the Courts of Law, as the Congress shall by law prescribe.  The
President may for any reason remove an inferior Officer appointed by the first

<p>
<p>
<p>
<h3>  Article 3 </h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court,
several Courts of Appeals, and further inferior Courts.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h4>  Selection </h4>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SUPREME COURT</b> --- The Supreme Court shall have 10 seats; the most senior 9
Justices shall be voting Justices and the remaining Justice shall not vote
except in cases of absence or recusal.  The most senior Justice, or a Justice
selected by a majority of voting Justices, shall be the Chief Justice of the
United States.
<p>
In May of each odd year, the most senior Justice shall retire from the Supreme
Court.  This and other vacancies shall be filled by <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Whittling</span>, as follows.
First, a list of candidates shall be compiled by adjoining, to the \(C+1\) many
Judges of the Courts of Appeals who do not explicitly decline, at most \(5\)
Candidates of the President's choice.  Second, the \(S\) many Senators shall
distribute points among the Candidates; but no Senator shall give more than
\(C\) points and no Candidate shall receive more than \(S\) points.  Third,
with the finalists being those candidates receiving strictly fewer than \(S\)
points, the most senior finalist, or a finalist of the President's choosing,
shall be appointed to the Supreme Court.  The first, second, and third steps
shall respectively conclude within 60, 120, and 180 days after vacancy.
<p>
The preceding two paragraphs shall take effect only 20 years after ratification
of this section.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>COURTS OF APPEALS</b> --- The Courts of Appeals shall in total have 180 seats,
and the Congress shall by law specify the structure of these Courts, and
partition their jurisdictions.
<p>
<p>
Vacancies shall be filled in pairs, as follows.  First, the President shall
nominate a pair of candidates.  Second, the President's pair shall be appointed
unless a group two fifths of Senators duly sworn nominate one alternative
Candidate from among the Judges of the United States.  In the latter case:
Third, a disjoint group of two fifths of Senators duly sworn may nominate a
second alternative candidate from among the Judges of the United States; and
Fourth, the Senate shall, by simple majority, choose either the original pair
or the alternative candidate(s) to fill the vacancies.  The first, second,

240 days after vacancy.
<p>
<p>
<p>

<b>TENURE</b> --- The Judges of United States shall during good behavior hold their
Offices until retirement (or death or resignation or impeachment for high
Crimes and Misdemeanors), during which their compensation shall not decrease.

Congress shall by law prescribe standards of integrity, uniform through all the
Courts of the United States, to be administered by the Courts themselves.  A
person having served 20 years as a Judge or Justice of the United States shall
upon retirement earn a pension equal to their compensation should they not have
retired.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h4>  Jurisdiction </h4>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>JUDICIAL REVIEW</b> --- The judicial power shall include the power to review the
actions of the United States and of any State as to their pursuance to this
Constitution.<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160This, the power of JUDICIAL REVIEW, is "implicit" in the old constitution.</span></span>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ENUMERATED JURISDICTIONS</b> --- The judicial power shall moreover extend:
<p>
To all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of
the United States, and Treaties made under their authority;
<p>
To controversies to which the United States shall be a party;
<p>
To controversies between two or more States;
<p>
To controversies between one or more States and a Foreign State;
<p>
To controversies commenced or prosecuted by a State against Citizens of another
State or incorporated Territory, or against Citizens or Subjects of a Foreign
State, but not commenced or prosecuted against a State by Citizens of another
State or incorporated Territory, or by Citizens or Subjects of a Foreign State;
<p>
To controversies between Citizens of the same State claiming lands under grants
of different States;

Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction.  In all other cases mentioned,
the Supreme Court shall take appeals from the Courts of Appeals, which shall
take appeals from the further inferior Courts; such appellate jurisdiction
shall pertain both to law and to fact.  But Congress may by Law extend the
original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, or make exceptions and regulations
to the hierarchy of appeals.<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160TODO</span></span>

<p>
<h3>  Article 4 </h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h4>  Membership in the Union </h4>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>STATEHOOD</b> --- Changes to the set of States comprising the Union, or to the
borders of those States, shall occur only with the conjunct approval of the
Legislatures of the States concerned and of the Congress.
<p>
Moreover, a change that increases the number of States in the Union shall, to
take effect, require such conjunct approval thrice, in three consecutive
Congresses.<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160Why so stringent?  Because of a constititional LOOPHOLE by which a
zealous national faction only slightly stronger than that required to make
veto-proof law could despite arbitrary opposition make Amendments --- say, to
bring back Prohibition!  Here, "slightly stronger" means the faction has
overwhelming support in some State --- say, Ohio (I'm from Michigan so I've got
to pick on them).  Then the faction would by Act of Congress and consent of
Ohio's Legilature split Ohio into many smaller States (Ohio's got over 250
incorporated cities), almost all of pro-Prohibition.  The faction would use
their veto-proof numbers in Congress to propose Prohibition, then their support
in three fourths of this new, enlarged set of States to ratify.  (If Ohioans
want, they could then re-merge.)  ... IN SHORT, the failure mode of State
splitting circumvents the three-fourths requirement for Amendements.  Sci-fi
indeed!  But unlike other sci-fi scenarios, this one has every step political
hence unjusticeable, and the People would, especially when the Senate becomes
packed by the new States, have no remedy at the ballot box.  The change proposed
exploits that Statehood, unlike many political questions, is non-urgent (after
all, naturalization takes years, so why should Statehood not?): three
consecutive elections is the minimum needed to guarantee that the President,
and every seat in the Congress, undergo intervening elections, and hence that
the People, upon recognizing the beginnings of Ohio's Prohibition Coup, can
stop it at the ballot box.</span></span>  But for 20 years after the ratification of this
paragraph, the Congress may by ordinary law grant Statehood to Puerto Rico or
to the Federal District.<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160In a long-standing issue, only marginally improved by
Amendment 23, there are now 4 million Americans in those two Territories denied
representation in Congress and other dignities of Statehood.  One way forward
is for the two to be admitted simultaneously to the Union, Harrison-style, with
balance maintained in the Senate because the Federal District is relatively
Blue and Puerto Rico relatively Red (e.g. see Puerto Rico's 2020
shall-issue unified-permit gun laws, or 2005 prohibition of abortion except to
save health or life, both currently effect).</span></span>
<p>
<b>TERRITORIES</b> --- The <em>incorporated Territories</em> shall be understood to include
the Federal District so long as the latter is not a State.
<p>
The incorporated Territories shall as one whole be entitled to as many
Representatives in the House, and as many presidential Electors, as if they
were one State.  The Congress shall by law determine the time, place, and
manner of elections in these incorporated Territories.
<p>
The Congress shall by Law make all needful rules and regulations respecting the
territory or other property belonging to the United States.
<p>
<p>
<p>

crime.
<p>
Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records,
and judicial Proceedings of every other State.  And the Congress may by general
Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records, and Proceedings shall be
proved, and <sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160WHAT</span></span> the effect thereof.

provisions of this section.
<p>
<p>

tidy way to make SLAVERY absolutely unconstitutional would be to delete this
final clause; and, to assuage those potential ratifiers who worry that this
would free all those imprisoned, to stipulate that "But incarceration for a
definite term and without forced activity, as a punishment for crime whereof
the party shall have been duly convicted, shall not be construed to be slavery
or involuntary servitude."</span></span> as punishment for crime (whereof the party shall
