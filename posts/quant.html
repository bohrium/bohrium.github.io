<h3>  Quantum Effects </h3>
<h4>  States, Operators, and Measurements </h4>
    We start with light, polarizers, and cameras.  Our experiments will shine light into a camera
    and record brightness.  We will potentially insert a sequence of polarizers in between.
<p>
    First, shine some light directly into the camera.  If the light source is very dim, then the
    camera will register a blip every now and then.  From this, we conclude that light comes in 
    particles --- <em>photons</em>.  We can thus imagine the outcome of each experiment in terms of an
    individual photon's journey or in aggregate --- say the average intensity over many blips is
    $1$.
<p>
    Let's now insert a polarizer.  The detected intensity becomes $1/4$.  So this polarizer seems
    to absorb most of the photons.  If we rotate this polarizer, the intensity does not change.
    In fact, the same happens with all the polarizing filters we have on hand.  Fix one of them
    and call it Polarizer A. 
<p>
    After Polarizer A, let's insert another polarizer B.  But this time, as we vary the orientation
    of B, the intensity varies from $0$ to $1/4$.  It seems that B is absorbing some of the photons
    that come out of A.  If we try another polarizer instead of B, then the intensity varies
    from $1/36$ to $1/9$; yet another polarizer stays constant at $1/16$.  In fact, every intensity   
    interval of form $[(-\epsilon+1/4)^2, (+\epsilon+1/4)^2]$ is represented.  But let's keep th
    original B and keep it at an angle that blocks all light.
<p>
    It seems that there are different flavors of light.  The light source gives off light that 
    is filtered the same way by all filters at all angles.  The light coming out of A is filtered
    the different ways. 
<p>
    We then insert another polarizer, this time perpendicular to
    the original.  The detected intensity becomes $0$.
