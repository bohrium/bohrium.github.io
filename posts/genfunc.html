<h1>  Generating Functions  </h1>

<h2>  Generating Functions for Counting </h2>
    If $a\in \NN^\NN$ is a sequence of non-negative integers, then its associated
    <b>generating series</b> is $F_a(z) = \sum \in \sum_{n\in \NN}a_n z^n \in \CC[[z]]$, an element of
    the formal power series ring.  For many interesting $a$, $F_a$ has positive radius of
    convergence and hence may be viewed as a function. 
<p>
<h3>  Example: Fun with Geometric Series  </h3>
    For instance, $a_n=1$ imples that $F_a=1/(1-z)$.  Then $a_n=n+1$ implies
    that $F_a=1/(1-z)^2$.
<p>
<h3>  Example: Solving Linear Recurrences </h3>
    For instance, let $a$ be defined by a linear recurrence:
    $a_n = s_n$ for $0\leq n \le N$ and $a_{n+N} = \sum_{0\leq i\le N} c_i a_{n+i}$ for $n\in \NN$.
    Then $F_a$ obeys the relation:  
    $F_a(z) = \sum_{0\leq n\le N} a_n z^n + \sum_{0\leq i\le N} c_i z^{N-i} = S(z) + C(z) F_a(z)$.
    So the following equality of functions holds when both sides are defined: 
        $$F_a(z) = \frac{S(z)}{1-C(z)}$$
    Via partial fraction decomposition, we write $F_a(z) = \sum_{0\leq i\le N} p_i(z)/(z-\lambda_i)$  
    with each $p_i\in \CC[z]$ and $\lambda_i\in \CC$.  We recognize this as a sum of geometric 
    series.  We conclude that $F_a$'s coefficients $a_n$ will eventually be a sum of exponentials!
    We could also have seen this by diagonalizing the relevant linear transform.  But generating
    functions emphasize the sequential nature of the problem; they can thus give more specific
    insights.
