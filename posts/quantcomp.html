<h5>  Sneaky Motivation for Quantum Computation </h5>
    The discreteness of combinatorial situations can lead to a frustrating lack of flexibility: to progress, one feels
    forced to break symmetries, do casework, and reason about obstinate constraint satisfaction problems.  But
    sometimes, by considering weighted averages of elements of discrete sets, one can do better.
    Thus, the standard proof of Sperner-type Lemmas pass through linear algebra intermediates.  
    To analyze finite groups, one may consider their linear representations.  
    The continuous, linear-algebra perspective gives powerful tools such as Kirchoff's Matrix Tree Theorem.  
<p>
    We thus wonder whether the digital logic of classical circuits can be made more powerful by linearization.  Instead
    of circuits $f: \{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^m$, let us consider linear operators $A: \CC^{(2^n)}\to \CC^{(2^m)}$.  
    It is encouraging that the state spaces of quantum mechanics are from some viewpoints free spaces generated by
    classical states.  However, in order to maintain the fragile superposition of states in $\CC^{2^\cdots}$, the machine
    must be insulated from thermal randomness.  But it is precisely thermal effects that allow classical gates
    such as <tt>AND</tt> to destroy information at macroscopic scales.  In the absence of this source of irreversibility, 
    we must analyze our physical systems as reversible.  Therefore, our quantum machines will have $n=m$, and
    $A$ will be a linear automorphism of $\CC^{2^n}$.
