!! A 22nd Century Constitution
!!!! Samuel Tenka, 2021

!!! Preface

    This is a fantasy.  It is as much wish fulfillment as it is science-fiction
speculation, and it lacks both plausibility and thoughtful ethical examination.
It reconciles my preferences --- for rule of law-as-text and for broad rights
and liberties --- by changing the text.  

!! Article I: The Legislature

!!! I.a. A Bicameral Congress

    All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the
United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.

!!!! I.a.0. Powers

    Specifically, the Congress shall have power:

    To provide for the general Welfare of the United States; to regulate
Commerce with foreign Nations and among the several States; to coin Money and
regulate the value thereof; to lay and collect Taxes and Duties; to borrow
Money on the credit of the United States, and to pay the Debts;

    To provide for the common defense of the United States; to declare War; To
provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia, and for governing
such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States.

    To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization;

    To constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court;

    And to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into
Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this
Constitution in the Government of the United States.

!!!! I.a.1. Restrictions

    And yet:

    No ex post facto Law shall be passed;

    No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State;

    No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of
Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and
Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time;

    And no Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no
Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the
Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of
any kind whatever, from any foreign State.

!!! I.b. The House of Representatives

!!!! I.b.0. Membership and Terms

    The House of Representatives shall have $1789$ seats in correspondence with
geographical districts so uniform that no district exceeds another in
census-measured population by a factor of $21/20$.  A Representative's term
shall endure $2$ years, and no person shall serve for multiple consecutive
terms in the House.

    Physically absent Representatives may still vote electronically.

!!!! I.b.1. Election

    The Representative for each district shall be decided as follows.  Each
citizen of voting age whose main residence falls within that district may cast
one vote for one candidate.  Meanwhile, the several candidates shall order
themselves alphabetically.  Each candidate shall privately determine a real,
$100$-digit number $x_i \in [0, 1]$.  Before election day, they shall
publically announce cryptographically secure hashes of their real numbers.  At
the close of the last ballot box, the candidates shall reveal their $x_i$s, and
the threshold $X$ shall be computed as the sum of the $x_i$s mod $1$.  The
votes shall be tallied for each candidate, then in the order determined by the
candidates partially summed; the first candidate whose corresponding partial
sum exceeds the threshold $X$ shall earn the seat in question.  Each candidate
shall be a citizen having attained at least $25$ years of age at the time of
election.
 
    Should an unexpected vacancy arise, the Chief Executive of the relevant
state shall appoint a temporary Representative.

!!!! I.b.2. Majority and Minority Leaders

    At each session's start, the convening Representatives shall together elect
a Majority Leader by simple unweighted majority; those Representatives who did
not vote for the resulting Majority Leader shall nominate an Minority Leader by
simple unweighted majority.  This process shall conclude within four weeks.

    The Majority and Minority Leaders shall preside over the House.

!!!! I.b.3. Voting 

    The will of the House shall unless otherwise specified be determined by
simple majority of weighted yeas and nays; no action shall be taken in case of
a tie.

    The House shall adopt no rules requiring majorities other than those here
specified. 

!!!! I.b.4. Procedure 

    Any Representative may propose a bill for discussion, and discussion shall
have a standard duration of $1$ business day.

    The Majority Leader may schedule votes to modify the duration of a bill's
discussion and to change chamber rules so long as they remain consistent with
this Constitution.  The Majority and Minority Leaders shall each month compose
an ordered sequence of items of business including discussion and
votes.  The House shall consider bills by alternating between the two Leaders'
lists, beginning with the Majority Leader's and skipping redundancies.  Should
both Leaders so move, discussion shall be suspended on a bill.  Should either
Leader so move, a vote will be held upon the end of discussion.  Should any
fifth of Representatives so move, the votes and proceedings shall be recorded
in the House Journal.

!!!! I.c.0. Membership and Terms

    The Senate shall have $2$ seats for each of the several States.  A
Senator's term shall endure $6$ years, and no person shall serve for multiple
consecutive terms in the Senate. 

!!!! I.c.1. Election

    The Several States shall upon entrance to the Union be divided as evenly as
possible into $3$ classes; each State in the $i$th class shall elect one of its
Senators in a year $6n + 2i$ and the other in a year $6n + 2(i+1)$.  A State's
Senatorial elections shall permit any citizen of voting age whose main
residence is that State to approve or disapprove of each Senatorial candidate;
that candidate that receives the fewest disapprovals shall earn the seat in
question.  Each candidate shall be a citizen having attained at least $30$
years of age at the time of election.

state shall appoint a temporary Senator.

unweighted majority.  This process shall conclude within four weeks.

    The Majority and Minority Leaders shall preside over the Senate.

!!!! I.c.3. Voting 

    Each seat shall, at the start of its term, be allotted $1868$ points (and
no more) to be spent on votes.  A Senator may vote with integer weight $n+1
\geq 0$ by spending $n^2$ points.  No Senator's points may fall below $0$.  The
will of the Senate shall unless otherwise specified be determined by majority
from the weighted yeas and nays; no action shall be taken in case of a tie.

    The Senate shall adopt no rules requiring majorities other than those here
specified. 

!!!! I.c.4. Procedure

so move, a vote will be held upon the end of discussion. 

    Should any Senator use a weight other than $1$, the chamber's votes shall

    Should any other member of the Executive Team of $6$ die, resign, or be
removed, the President shall fill each vacancy with the approval of an
unweighted simple majority of the Senate.  The same shall occur should any

proceed to reconsider it.  If after such Reconsideration $2/3$rds of House of
Representatives shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall become a Law.

!!! II.f. War Powers

    The President shall exercise the armed forces abroad upon and only upon
        an emergency created by a specific and likely potential or recent

        or in situations as the Congress may
            by $2/3$s unweighted majorities in both houses
            and with specific and prompt termination

    The Supreme Court shall have 10 members, of which the most senior 9 are
voting Justices and of which the remaining member is a non-voting
Justice-in-Waiting.  The most senior Justice shall be known as the Chief
Justice.
  
    Each Justice shall serve one term of 20 years, with time on the nonvoting

!!!! III.b.1. Appointment

    In each odd year, the President shall nominate to the Court some citizen
having attained at least $35$ and no more than $70$ years of age.

    The fraction of the Senate eligible to vote on this matter may approve the
candidate by a simple majority.  If the Court's 10 seats are all filled and the
candidate is approved, then Chief Justice shall retire, the Justice-in-Waiting
shall become a voting Justice and the nominee shall become a
Justice-in-Waiting.

    Should the above vote fail to form a two-thirds majority, then the seats
comprising the majority, whether that majority be of Yeas or Nays, shall be
ineligible to vote on the next nomination.  To each seat of the Senate is hence
assigned an evolving bit of information.  Upon ratification of this
