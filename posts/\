!! A 22nd Century Constitution
!!!! Samuel Tenka, 2020 February

!!! Preface

    This is a fantasy.  It is as much romantic wish fulfillment as it is
    science-fictional speculation, and it lacks both plausibility and
    thoughtful ethical examination.  It reconciles my preferences --- for rule
    of law through textualist interpretation and for personal liberty as
    imagined in modern times --- by changing the text.  It also tries to do
    away with artifacts of a less connected age.

!! Article I: The Legislature

!!! I.a. A Bicameral Congress

!!! I.b. The House of Representatives

!!!! I.b.0. Membership, Terms, and Election
    The House of Representatives shall have $1776$ seats in
    correspondence with geographical districts so uniform
    that no district exceeds another in census-measured population by a factor
    of $21/20$.  A representative's term shall
    endure $2$ years, and no person shall serve two consecutive terms in the
    House.

    The representative for each district shall be decided as follows.
    Each Citizen of voting age whose main residence falls within that distict
    may cast one vote for one candidate.
    Meanwhile, the several candidates shall order themselves alphabetically.
    Each candidate shall privately determine a real, $20$-digit number
    $x_i \in [0, 1]$.  Before election day, they shall publically announce
    cryptographically secure hashes of their real numbers.  At the close of
    the last ballot box, the candidates shall reveal $x_i$s, and the threshold
    $X$ shall be computed as the sum of the $x_i$s mod $1$.  The votes shall
    be tallied for each candidate, then in the order determined by the
    candidates partially summed; the first candidate whose corresponding
    partial sum exceeds the threshold $X$ shall earn the seat in question.
 
    Should an unexpected vacancy arise, the Chief Executive of the relevant
    state shall appoint a temporary Representative.

!!!! I.b.1. Majority and Alternative Leaders

    At each session's start, the convening representatives shall together elect 
    a majority leader by simple unweighted majority; those senators who
    did not vote for the resulting Majority Leader shall nominate an Alternative
    Leader by simple unweighted majority.  For these votes, the
    Vice President shall resolve ties.  This process must resolve within four
    weeks.

!!! I.c. The Senate 
!!!! I.c.0. Membership, Terms, and Election
    The Senate shall have $2$ seats for each of the several States.
    A senator's term shall endure $6$ years, and no person shall serve two
    consecutive terms in the Senate.

    The Several States shall upon entrance to the Union be divided as evenly
    as possible into $3$ classes; the $i$th class shall elect one of its
    senators in a year $6n + 2i$ and the other in a year $6n + 2i+1$.
    A State's senatorial elections shall permit any Citizen of voting age whose
    main residence is that State to approve or disapprove of each senatorial
    candidate; that candidate that receives the fewest disapprovals shall earn
    the seat in question.

    Should an unexpected vacancy arise, the Chief Executive of the relevant
    state shall appoint a temporary Senator.

!!!! I.c.1. Majority and Alternative Leaders
 
    At each session's start, the convening senators shall together elect 
    a majority leader by simple unweighted majority; those senators who
    did not vote for the resulting Majority Leader shall nominate an Alternative
    Leader by simple unweighted majority.  For these votes, the
    Vice President shall resolve ties.  This process must resolve within four
    weeks.

!!!! I.c.1. Voting 
    Each seat shall, at the start of its term, 
    be allotted $1789$ points to be spent on votes. 
    A seat may vote with integer weight $n+1 \geq 0$ by spending $n^2$
    points.  No vote may cause the allotted points to fall below $0$. 
    The will of the Senate shall unless otherwise specified be determined by
    strict majority among the weighted yeas and nays; no action shall be taken
    in case of a tie.

    Members may vote 

    The Senate shall adopt no rules requiring majorities other than those here
    specified.

!!!! I.c.3. 
!!!! I.c.4. 

!!! I.d. Revenue and Monetary Powers
!!! I.e. Other Powers

!! Article II: The Executive

!!! II.a. The Executive Hierarchy and Election
    
    The President of the United States shall lead the Executive Branch with
    the assistance of a Vice President and their Cabinet.

    The President, Vice President, and the four named members of the Cabinet
    --- the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Treasury,
    and Attorney General --- shall be elected every $4$ years.  

    No person may serve as President for more than one full term. 

!!! II.b. The President
!!! II.c. The Vice President
!!! II.d. The Cabinet
!!!! II.d.0. Membership and Appointment 

    The Executive's Cabinet shall consist of
        a Secretary of State,
        a Secretary of Defense,
        a Secretary of the Treasury,
        an Attorney General,
        a Secretary of Homeland Security,
        a Secretary of the Interior,
        a Secretary of Commerce,
    and a number of department heads as the Congress may by law provide.

!!! II.e. Order of Succession
!!! II.f. War and Diplomacy Powers

!! Article III: The Judiciary

!!! III.a. The Courts
    The federal courts shall consist of one Supreme Court, several Courts of
    Appeals in correspondence with the seats of that court, and lower courts as
    Congress may by law provide.

!!! III.b. The Supreme Court
!!!! III.b.0. Membership and Terms
    The Supreme Court shall have 9 voting seats and 3 nonvoting seats.
    Should a vacancy arise among the voting seats, a most senior of the
    nonvoting members shall rise into the vacated seat.  
    Each justice shall serve one term of 15 years, with time on nonvoting
    seats included, 
    or as death, resignation, or impeachment interrupt.
    The most senior Justice shall be known as Chief Justice.

!!!! III.b.1. Appointment
    The Chief Executives, or Governors, of the Several States shall fill a
    vacancy as follows.  The Governors shall each nominate at most one
    candidate.  Candidates shall be Citizens within 30 and 60 years of age,
    inclusive, at the time of nomination.  The Governors must together nominate
    at least two candidates. 

    Until one candidate remains, the Governors shall then declare their
    approval or disapproval for each candidate, hence eliminating the most
    disapproved candidate.  The youngest voting State shall break ties between
    multiple maximally disapproved candidates.

    In the final round of voting, should no two-thirds majority emerge, the
    states comprising the majority, including in the case of a tie that youngest
    voting State that broke the tie, shall be barred from voting for the next
    vacancy-filling.  Those States shall once again be considered voting states
    in the vacancy after the next.  To each State is hence assigned an evolving
    bit of information; upon ratification, all States shall be considered
    voting States except those from which the current Justices hail. 

    This whole process shall complete within one twelve months of the original
    vacancy.
