<h2>  Rocks <em>Ab Initio</em> </h2>
<h5>  Notes on Geology by Samuel Tenka </h5>
<p>
<h3>  Hello </h3>
    Look around your apartment, and you'll see many rocks.  From chalk's porous limestone to the smooth slate
    of blackboards, <b>rocks</b> --- that is, solid mineral aggregates --- abound.  Now scan beyond your window: notice a
    passerby slipping on compacted snow; observe an empire built on the energy of coal; imagine
    the obsidian arrowheads veiled from view by grass and soil and millenia.  Rocks are Nature's building blocks.
<p>
    But rocks are not static: in their constant flows and fluxes they are the very scroll on which Nature writes her
    history.  Hold a rock, and feel the weight of its age, the wisdom of its dimpled skin.  Its molecules may well have
    witnessed the birth of life itself.  In their eternal dance of deposition and erosion, those molecules endure the
    cruel pressures of inner earth, rising only as tortured tectonic plates screech and wrestle and belch their innards
    out.  As exiles, they drift from dune to dune across ancient deserts.  Some even dissolve in animal stomachs only
    to reincarnate as the sheen of a beautiful shell.  <b>Geology</b>, then, distinguishes itself in the pace and subtle
    violence of the processes it studies.
<p>
    These notes tour the many facets of rocks and their history.  Assuming no background, we build from the basics:
    quantum mechanics to explain the material properties of rock, cosmology to describe the origins of rock, evolutionary
    theory to understand the interactions of rock and life, and fluid dynamics to model the climate that so affects
    surface geology.  From here, we briefly describe a diverse set of processes such as the saltation of sand and the
    life cycle of hoodoos.  We finally survey two major applications of rocks: the construction of Turing-complete
    machines from silicon and rock-based survival skills.
<p>
    All said, geology is a central science.  If Aristotle's earth tended to sink below water, air, and fire, so too 
    does geology tend to motivate the more applied sciences of physics, chemistry, and biology.  But to call geology
    impractical is to err.  While our technical preparations may petrify the uninitiated, just think, dear reader,
    whenever you waver, of the dominion of human above rock in that grandest of engineering triumphs: Khufu's pyramid.  
    Oriented thus with curiosity and pluck, let us climb our own pyramid.  We begin at the beginning: with field
    theory.
<p>
<h3>  Inside Rocks </h3>
    To study a whole, we study its parts.   
    Rocks are made of minerals, and minerals are made of molecules, and molecules are made of electrons and quarks.
    Thus, let us study rocks by understanding electrons and quarks.  The world of such elementary particles is  
    strange!  Indeed, at these small scales, the nondeterminism of nature becomes impossible to neglect.  We
    will be unable to describe the interactions of electrons in terms of classical concepts such as force; instead,
    we will build up a whole new framework: Quantum Mechanics.       
<p>
<h4>  Quantum Mechanics  </h4>
<h5>  Nature is Random </h5>
    Though experiment is science's soul, it turns out that an experiment's initial conditions do not determine
    its outcome.  Here, we will describe an experiment that  
<p>
    Indeed, as scientists, we might work with <b>pure states</b>, each of which encodes the state of
    the universe via a maximal amount of knowledge about future experiments.
<p>
    If $a$ and $b$ are pure states and $E$
    is an experiment, let us write $P(a|E|b)$ for the probability of arriving at $a$ via $E$ from $b$.
<p>
    Quantum physics postulates that the pure states correspond to the unit-norm vectors in a complex Hilbert space and
    that each experiment can be encoded in a linear map such that $P(a|E|b) = \left| \langle a | E(b)\rangle \right|^2$
    whenever $a$ is a possible outcome of $E$.  In fact, the experimental outcomes form an orthonormal basis for the
    whole Hilbert space.  Then a sequence of experiments with final result $a$, intermediate result $b$, and initial
    result $c$ has outcome probability $P(a|E|b|F|c) = \left| \langle a|E(b)\rangle \langle b|F(c)\rangle \right|^2$
    However, if we don't measure the intermediate result, we sum over possible intermediate states inside the norm: 
    $$P(a|EF|c) = \left|\sum_b \langle a|E(b)\rangle \langle b|F(c) \rangle \right|^2 = \left|\langle a|EF(c)\right|^2$$
    Those are the rules of quantum physics.
<p>
    The inner products are called <b>amplitudes</b>.
<p>
    We will now illustrate these ideas for a quantum system whose associated Hilbert space has two complex dimensions.
    Let us choose $u, d$ as an orthonormal basis of pure states.  Then every other pure state has form
    $s = \alpha u + \beta d$ where $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$.  CONTINUE 
<p>
<h5>  Path Integral Formalism </h5>
    For instance, consider an electron, which has classical internal states $up$ and $down$.  A classical path over a
    duration $[0,T]$ is then a piecewise constant function $\phi: [0,T]\to\{up, down\}=\{\pm 1\}$.  The electron
    evolves in a vertical magnetic field $B$ according to the following action:
        $$\text{action}(\phi) := \frac{qB\hbar}{2m} \int_{[0,T]} \phi(t)$$
    Then the amplitude to go from $up$ to $up$ after $T$ steps is   
<p>
    We often care about the    
    Now, the amplitudes for experiments of form <tt></tt>measure-after-waiting-after-preparing'' are given by a formula
    $$\langle a | b \rangle = \int_\phi \exp((i/\hbar) \, \text{action}(\phi)) $$
    where $\phi$ ranges

<h3>  Biology of Rocks </h3>
<h4>  Are Rocks Alive? </h4>
    What does it mean to <b>live</b>?  What is <b>life</b>?  These are some of the central questions of biology, and hence by
    extension geology.  Toward a definition, we note these characteristics of life as we intuitively understand it: 
<p>
    (A) Life reproduces (potentially with mutation) and hence undergoes natural selection. 
<p>
    (B) The information that reproduces is encoded chemically.
<p>
    Taking the above as a definition of life, we ask <em>can rocks reproduce</em> and
    <em>is a rock's salient genetic informationi encoded chemically</em>?
