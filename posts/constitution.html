<h3>  A Constitution </h3>
<h5>  Samuel Tenka, 2021 </h5>
<p>
<h4>  Preface </h4>
<p>
    This is a fantasy.  It is as much wish fulfillment as it is science-fiction
speculation, and it lacks both plausibility and thoughtful ethical examination.
It reconciles my preferences --- for rule of law-as-text and for broad rights
and liberties --- by changing the text.  
<p>
<h3>  Article I: The Legislature </h3>
<p>
<h4>  I.a. A Bicameral Congress </h4>
<p>
    All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the
United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.
<p>
<h5>  I.a.0. Powers </h5>
<p>
    Specifically, the Congress shall have power:
<p>
    To provide for the general Welfare of the United States; to regulate
Commerce with foreign Nations and among the several States; to coin Money and
regulate the value thereof; to lay and collect Taxes and Duties; to borrow
Money on the credit of the United States, and to pay the Debts;
<p>
    To provide for the common defense of the United States; to declare War; To
provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia, and for governing
such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States.
<p>
    To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization;
<p>
    To constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court;
<p>
    And to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into
Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this
Constitution in the Government of the United States.
<p>
<h5>  I.a.1. Restrictions </h5>
<p>
    And yet:
<p>
    No ex post facto Law shall be passed;
<p>
    No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State;
<p>
    No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of
Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and
Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time;
<p>
    And no Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no
Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the
Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of
any kind whatever, from any foreign State.
<p>
<h4>  I.b. The House of Representatives </h4>
<p>
<h5>  I.b.0. Membership and Terms </h5>
<p>
    The House of Representatives shall have $1789$ seats in correspondence with
geographical districts so uniform that no district exceeds another in
census-measured population by a factor of $21/20$.  A Representative's term
shall endure $2$ years, and no person shall serve for multiple consecutive
terms in the House.
<p>
    Physically absent Representatives may still vote electronically.
<p>
<h5>  I.b.1. Election </h5>
<p>
    The Representative for each district shall be decided as follows.  Each
citizen of voting age whose main residence falls within that district may cast
one vote for one candidate.  Meanwhile, the several candidates shall order
themselves alphabetically.  Each candidate shall privately determine a real,
$100$-digit number $x_i \in [0, 1]$.  Before election day, they shall
publically announce cryptographically secure hashes of their real numbers.  At
the close of the last ballot box, the candidates shall reveal their $x_i$s, and
the threshold $X$ shall be computed as the sum of the $x_i$s mod $1$.  The
votes shall be tallied for each candidate, then in the order determined by the
candidates partially summed; the first candidate whose corresponding partial
sum exceeds the threshold $X$ shall earn the seat in question.  Each candidate
shall be a citizen having attained at least $25$ years of age at the time of
election.
<p>
    Should an unexpected vacancy arise, the Chief Executive of the relevant
state shall appoint a temporary Representative.
<p>
<h5>  I.b.2. Majority and Minority Leaders </h5>
<p>
    At each session's start, the convening Representatives shall together elect
a Majority Leader by simple unweighted majority; those Representatives who did
not vote for the resulting Majority Leader shall nominate an Minority Leader by
simple unweighted majority.  This process shall conclude within four weeks.
<p>
    The Majority and Minority Leaders shall preside over the House.
<p>
<h5>  I.b.3. Voting  </h5>
<p>
    The will of the House shall unless otherwise specified be determined by
simple majority of weighted yeas and nays; no action shall be taken in case of
a tie.
<p>
    The House shall adopt no rules requiring majorities other than those here
specified. 
<p>
<h5>  I.b.4. Procedure  </h5>
<p>
    Any Representative may propose a bill for discussion, and discussion shall
have a standard duration of $1$ business day.
<p>
    The Majority Leader may schedule votes to modify the duration of a bill's
discussion and to change chamber rules so long as they remain consistent with
this Constitution.  The Majority and Minority Leaders shall each month compose
an ordered sequence of items of business including discussion and
votes.  The House shall consider bills by alternating between the two Leaders'
lists, beginning with the Majority Leader's and skipping redundancies.  Should
both Leaders so move, discussion shall be suspended on a bill.  Should either
Leader so move, a vote will be held upon the end of discussion.  Should any
fifth of Representatives so move, the votes and proceedings shall be recorded
in the House Journal. 
<p>
<h4>  I.c. The Senate  </h4>
<p>
<h5>  I.c.0. Membership and Terms </h5>
<p>
    The Senate shall have $2$ seats for each of the several States.  A
Senator's term shall endure $6$ years, and no person shall serve for multiple
consecutive terms in the Senate. 
<p>
<h5>  I.c.1. Election </h5>
<p>
    The Several States shall upon entrance to the Union be divided as evenly as
possible into $3$ classes; each State in the $i$th class shall elect one of its
Senators in a year $6n + 2i$ and the other in a year $6n + 2(i+1)$.  A State's
Senatorial elections shall permit any citizen of voting age whose main
residence is that State to approve or disapprove of each Senatorial candidate;
that candidate that receives the fewest disapprovals shall earn the seat in
question.  Each candidate shall be a citizen having attained at least $30$
years of age at the time of election.
<p>
    Should an unexpected vacancy arise, the Chief Executive of the relevant
state shall appoint a temporary Senator.
<p>
<h5>  I.c.2. Majority and Minority Leaders </h5>
<p>
    At each session's start, the convening Senators shall together elect a
Majority Leader by simple unweighted majority; those Senators who did not vote
for the resulting Majority Leader shall nominate an Minority Leader by simple
unweighted majority.  This process shall conclude within four weeks.
<p>
    The Majority and Minority Leaders shall preside over the Senate.
<p>
<h5>  I.c.3. Voting  </h5>
<p>
    Each seat shall, at the start of its term, be allotted $1868$ points (and
no more) to be spent on votes.  A Senator may vote with integer weight $n+1
\geq 0$ by spending $n^2$ points.  No Senator's points may fall below $0$.  The
will of the Senate shall unless otherwise specified be determined by majority
from the weighted yeas and nays; no action shall be taken in case of a tie.
<p>
    The Senate shall adopt no rules requiring majorities other than those here
specified. 
<p>
<h5>  I.c.4. Procedure  </h5>

discussion and to change chamber rules so long as they remain consistent with
this Constitution.  The Majority and Minority Leaders shall each month compose
an ordered sequence of items of business including discussion and votes.  The
Senate shall consider bills by alternating between the two Leaders' lists,
beginning with the Majority Leader's and skipping redundancies.  Should both
Leaders so move, discussion shall be suspended on a bill.  Should any Senator
so move, a vote will be held upon the end of discussion. 
<p>
    Should any Senator use a weight other than $1$, the chamber's votes shall
be tallied precisely.  Should any fifth of Senators so move, the votes and
proceedings shall be recorded in the Senate Journal. 
<p>

<h3>  Article II: The Executive Branch </h3>
<p>

<p>
<h5>  II.a.0. Structure </h5>
<p>
    The President of the United States shall execute the Laws with the
assistance of a Vice President and a Cabinet.  The President, Vice President,
Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Treasury, and
Attorney General, shall be known as the Executive Team.  
<p>
    The President and Vice President shall at the time of election or

years of age.  No person shall serve for more than $6$ years as President.
<p>
<h5>  II.a.1. Election </h5>
<p>
    An Executive Team shall be elected every $4$ years from among candidate
teams, each of distinct persons and with every two teams disjoint.  Each
citizen of voting age may approve or disapprove of each candidate team.  A
citizen's vote in state $x$ shall be multiplied by $4 + PN/P_x$, where
$P$ is the number of citizens total, $P_x$ counts the citizens in $x$, and
there are $N$ states.  The team least disapproved in total shall be chosen.
<p>
<h5>  II.a.2. Emergency Succession </h5>

    the Secretary of Defense,
    the Secretary of the Treasury, and
    the Attorney General
    --- shall immediately become President.   
    The same shall occur should any majority of the remaining members of
    the Executive Team assess the President as incapacitated.
<p>
    Should any other member of the Executive Team die, resign, or be removed,
the President shall fill each vacancy with the approval of an unweighted simple
majority of the Senate.  The same shall occur should any majority of the
remaining members of the Executive Team deem the member incapacitated.
<p>
    It is advised that the members of the Executive Team shall never
simultaneously occupy the same physical grounds. 
<p>
<h4>  II.b. The President </h4>
<h4>  II.c. The Vice President </h4>
<h4>  II.d. The Cabinet </h4>
<p>
<h5>  II.d.0. Protected Organs of the Executive Branch </h5>
<p>
    The Congress may by $2/3$s unweighted majorities in both houses inhibit all
present and future Executives from interfering with any part of the executive
branch save the armed forces; and as the Congress may inhibit, so may it
enable.  Upon ratification of this Constitution, the Federal Reserve and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation shall by default be so protected.
<p>
<h5>  II.d.1. The Departments  </h5>

<p>
<h5>  II.e.0. Executive Orders </h5>
<p>
    The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of
America, who shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.  Toward this
goal, the President may issue Executive Orders, subject to review by the
Supreme Court as to constitutionality and legality. 
<p>
    The President shall lack power to pardon.
<p>
<h5>  II.e.1. The Military </h5>
<p>
    The President shall be the Commander in Chief of the military forces of
United States, and of the militia of the several States, when called into the
actual service of the United States. 
<p>
<h5>  II.e.2. Presidential Veto Power </h5>
<p>
    Each Bill that has passed both houses of Congress shall, before it becomes
a Law, shall be presented to the President.  If they approve they shall sign
it.  If not, they shall return it to the House of Representatives, who shall
proceed to reconsider it.  If after such Reconsideration $2/3$rds of House of
Representatives shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall become a Law.
<p>
<h4>  II.f. War Powers </h4>
<p>
    The President shall exercise the armed forces abroad upon and only upon
        an emergency created by a specific and likely potential or recent
        attack upon the territories, posessions, or armed forces of the
        United States;
        or in situations as the Congress may
            by $2/3$s unweighted majorities in both houses
            and with specific and prompt termination
            conditions
        describe;
        or with Authorization for Use of Military Force, issued by the
        Congress and specific as to duration, cause, and adversary.
<p>
    The President must inform the Congress within $48$ hours of the beginning
    of any conflict begun without an Authorization of Use of Military Force.
    Conflict includes deployment of armed forces personnel or of lethal
    weaponry.  Such conflicts must cease within $60$ days, barring
    Congressional approval.
<p>

<p>

<p>
    The Supreme Court shall have 10 members, of which the most senior 9 are

    Each Justice shall serve one term of 20 years, with time on the nonvoting

<p>
    In each odd year, the President shall nominate to the Court some citizen

<p>
    The fraction of the Senate eligible to vote on this matter may approve the
candidate by a simple majority.  If the Court's 10 seats are all filled and the
candidate is approved, then Chief Justice shall retire, the Justice-in-Waiting
shall become a voting Justice and the nominee shall become a
Justice-in-Waiting.
<p>
    Should the above vote fail to form a two-thirds majority, then the seats
comprising the majority, whether that majority be of Yeas or Nays, shall be
ineligible to vote on the next nomination.  To each seat of the Senate is hence
assigned an evolving bit of information.  Upon ratification of this
Constitution, all Senate seats shall be considered eligible.
