<h3>  A 22nd Century Constitution </h3>
<h5>  Samuel Tenka, 2020 February </h5>
<p>
<h4>  Preface </h4>
<p>
    This is a fantasy.  It is as much romantic wish fulfillment as it is
    science-fictional speculation, and it lacks both plausibility and
    thoughtful ethical examination.  It reconciles my preferences --- for rule
    of law through textualist interpretation and for personal liberty as
    imagined in modern times --- by changing the text.  It also tries to do
    away with artifacts of a less connected age.
<p>
<h3>  Article I: The Legislature </h3>
<p>
<h4>  I.a. A Bicameral Congress </h4>
<p>
<h4>  I.b. The House of Representatives </h4>
<p>
<h5>  I.b.0. Membership and Terms </h5>
<p>
    The House of Representatives shall have $1789$ seats in
    correspondence with geographical districts so uniform
    that no district exceeds another in census-measured population by a factor
    of $21/20$.  A Representative's term shall endure $2$ years, and no person
    shall serve for multiple consecutive terms in the House.
<p>
<h5>  I.b.1. Election </h5>
<p>
    The Representative for each district shall be decided as follows.
    Each citizen of voting age whose main residence falls within that district
    may cast one vote for one candidate.
    Meanwhile, the several candidates shall order themselves alphabetically.
    Each candidate shall privately determine a real, $1000$-digit number
    $x_i \in [0, 1]$.  Before election day, they shall publically announce
    cryptographically secure hashes of their real numbers.  At the close of
    the last ballot box, the candidates shall reveal $x_i$s, and the threshold
    $X$ shall be computed as the sum of the $x_i$s mod $1$.  The votes shall
    be tallied for each candidate, then in the order determined by the
    candidates partially summed; the first candidate whose corresponding
    partial sum exceeds the threshold $X$ shall earn the seat in question.
    Each candidate shall be a citizen having attained at least
    $25$ years of age at the time of election.
<p>
    Should an unexpected vacancy arise, the Chief Executive of the relevant
    state shall appoint a temporary Representative.
<p>
<h5>  I.b.2. Majority and Alternative Leaders </h5>
<p>
    At each session's start, the convening Representatives shall together elect 
    a Majority Leader by simple unweighted majority; those senators who
    did not vote for the resulting Majority Leader shall nominate an Alternative
    Leader by simple unweighted majority.  For these votes, the
    Vice President shall resolve ties.  This process must resolve within four
    weeks.
<p>
    The Majority and Alternative Leaders shall preside over the House.
<p>
<h4>  I.c. The Senate  </h4>
<p>
<h5>  I.c.0. Membership and Terms </h5>
<p>
    The Senate shall have $2$ seats for each of the several States.
    A senator's term shall endure $6$ years, and no person shall serve for
    multiple consecutive terms in the Senate. 
<p>
<h5>  I.c.1. Election </h5>
<p>
    The Several States shall upon entrance to the Union be divided as evenly
    as possible into $3$ classes; the $i$th class shall elect one of its
    senators in a year $6n + 2i$ and the other in a year $6n + 2i+1$.
    A State's senatorial elections shall permit any citizen of voting age whose
    main residence is that State to approve or disapprove of each senatorial
    candidate; that candidate that receives the fewest disapprovals shall earn
    the seat in question.
    Each candidate shall be a citizen having attained at least
    $30$ years of age at the time of election.
<p>
    Should an unexpected vacancy arise, the Chief Executive of the relevant
    state shall appoint a temporary Senator.
<p>
<h5>  I.c.2. Majority and Alternative Leaders </h5>
<p>
    At each session's start, the convening senators shall together elect 
    a Majority Leader by simple unweighted majority; those senators who
    did not vote for the resulting Majority Leader shall nominate an Alternative
    Leader by simple unweighted majority.  For these votes, the
    Vice President shall resolve ties.  This process must resolve within four
    weeks.
<p>
    The Majority and Alternative Leaders shall preside over the Senate.
<p>
<h5>  I.c.3. Voting  </h5>
<p>
    Each seat shall, at the start of its term, be allotted $1868$ points to be
    spent on votes.  A senator may vote with integer weight $n+1 \geq 0$ by
    spending $n^2$ points.  No vote may cause the allotted points to fall below
    $0$.  The will of the Senate shall unless otherwise specified be determined by
    majority from the weighted yeas and nays; no action shall be taken in case of a
    tie.
<p>
    The Senate shall adopt no rules requiring majorities other than those here
    specified. 
<p>
<h5>  I.c.3. Procedure  </h5>
<p>
    Any senator may propose a bill for discussion, and discussion shall have
    a standard duration of $5$ days.
    The Majority Leader may schedule votes to modify the duration of a bill's
    discussion and to change chamber rules so long as they remain consistent
    with this Constitution.  
    The Majority and Alternative Leaders shall each month compose an ordered
    sequence of items of business including discussion, speeches, and votes.
    The Senate
    shall consider bills by alternating between the two Leaders' lists,
    beginning with the Majority Leader's and skipping redundancies. 
    Should both Leaders so move, discussion shall be suspended on a bill.
    Should either Leader so move, a vote will be held upon the end of
    discussion. 
    Should any senator use a weight other than $1$, the chamber's votes shall
    be tallied precisely.
    Should any fifth of Senators so move, the votes and proceedings shall be
    recorded in the Senate Journal.

<p>
    The President of the United States shall execute the Laws with
    the assistance of a Vice President and a Cabinet.  The President,

    A Team of $6$ shall be elected every $4$ years from among
    candidate teams, each of distinct persons and with every two teams disjoint.
    Each citizen of voting age may approve or disapprove of each
    candidate team.  A citizen's shall be multiplied bbby $\frac{n+2}{n}$,
    where $n$ counts the number of Representatives in that citizen's State.
    The team least disapproved in total shall be chosen.
<p>
<h5>  II.a.2. Emergency Succession </h5>
<p>
    Should the President die, resign, or be removed, the first
    listed --- among
    the Vice President,
    the Secretary of State,
    the Secretary of Defense,
    the Secretary of the Treasury, and
    the Attorney General
    --- shall immediately become President.  
    The same shall occur should any majority of the remaining members of
    the Team of $6$ deem the President incapacitated.
<p>
    Should any other member of the Team of $6$ die, resign, or be removed,
    the President shall fill each vacancy
    with the approval of an unweighted majority of the Senate. 
    The same shall occur should any majority of the remaining members of
    the Team of $6$ deem a member incapacitated.
<p>
    It is advised that the members of the Team of $6$ shall never
    simultaneously occupy the same physical grounds. 
<p>
<h4>  II.b. The President </h4>
<h4>  II.c. The Vice President </h4>
<h4>  II.d. The Cabinet </h4>

<h5>  II.d.0. Protected Organs of the Executive Branch </h5>
<p>
    The Congress may by $2/3$s unweighted majorities in both houses inhibit all
    present and future Executives from interfering with any part
    of the executive branch save the armed forces;
    and as the Congress may inhibit, so may it enable.
    Upon ratification of this Constitution, the Federal Reserve and the
    Federal Bureau of Investigation shall by default be so protected.
<p>
<h5>  II.d.1. The Departments  </h5>

    United States, and of the militia of the several States, when called into
    the actual service of the United States.

<p>
<h4>  II.f. Executive Orders </h4>
<p>
<h4>  II.g. War Powers </h4>
<p>
<h5>  II.g.0. Emergency Conflicts </h5>
<p>
    The President shall exercise the armed forces abroad upon and only upon
        an emergency created by a specific and likely potential or recent
        attack of upon the territories, posessions, or armed forces of the
        United States;
        or in situations as the Congress may
            by $2/3$s majorities in both houses
            and with specific and prompt termination
            conditions
        describe;
        or with Authorization for Use of Military Force, issued by the
        Congress and specific as to duration, cause, and adversary; 
<p>
    The President must inform the Congress within $48$ hours of the beginning
    of any conflict begun without an Authorization of Use of Military Force.
    Conflict includes deployment of armed forces personnel or of lethal weaponry.
    Such conflicts must cease within $60$ days, barring Congressional approval.
<p>
<h3>  Article III: The Judiciary </h3>
<p>
<h4>  III.a. The Courts </h4>
    The federal courts shall consist of one Supreme Court, several Courts of
    Appeals, and lower courts as Congress may by law provide.
<p>
<h4>  III.b. The Supreme Court </h4>
<h5>  III.b.0. Membership and Terms </h5>
    The Supreme Court shall have 9 voting seats and 3 nonvoting seats.
    Should a vacancy arise among the voting seats, a most senior of the
    nonvoting members shall rise into the vacated seat.  
    Each justice shall serve one term of 15 years, with time on nonvoting
    seats included, 
    or as death, resignation, or impeachment interrupt.
    The most senior Justice shall be known as Chief Justice.
<p>
<h5>  III.b.1. Appointment </h5>
<p>
    The Chief Executives, or Governors, of the Several States shall fill a
    vacancy as follows.  Each Governor shall nominate at most one
    candidate.
    Each candidate shall be a citizen having attained
    at least $35$ and no more than $70$ years
    of age at the time of nomination.
    The Governors must together nominate
    at least two candidates. 
<p>
    Until one candidate remains, the Governors shall then declare their
    approval or disapproval for each candidate, hence eliminating the most
    disapproved candidate.  The youngest voting State shall break ties between
    multiple maximally disapproved candidates.
<p>
    In the final round of voting, should no two-thirds majority emerge, the
    states comprising the majority, including in the case of a tie that youngest
    voting State that broke the tie, shall be barred from voting for the next
    vacancy-filling.  Those States shall once again be considered voting states
    in the vacancy after the next.  To each State is hence assigned an evolving
    bit of information; upon ratification, all States shall be considered
    voting States except those from which the current Justices hail. 
<p>
    This whole process shall complete within one twelve months of the original
    vacancy.
