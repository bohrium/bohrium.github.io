! Let "We" Convene Outside the Box
!!!! Samuel Tenka, 2023

This is an essay of advocacy and imagination for my fellow Americans.  I aim to
persuade you that it is time to amend our Constitution, and I shall do so by
sparking our imaginations for what is possible.  Beyond the usual suspects ---
amendments popular only within one major party --- there lies a wealth of
smaller but impactful, potentially broadly popular structural reforms.  We
citizens ought to discover and debate such potential amendments as routinely as
we consider more urgent and concrete policies; this is long-term maintenance of
our political body: the flossing that lets us to chew heartily even 50 years
hence.
#
Advocating for constitutional amendements is, to me, no more quixotic than
marking a presidential ballot, and worthwhile in the same ways, if not by
expected utility then by some sacred meme of duty.
#
Perhaps you will disagree; if so, I hope to read a letter from you, to learn.

I will refer to remarks on the Constitution by some of the Justices, Senators,
and Presidents who served in this century:
*A.Scalia*,
*B.Obama*,
*D.Trump*
*E.Warren*,
*J.Manchin*,
*M.Romney*,
*R.Ginsburg*,
*R.Paul*,
*S.Breyer*,
*W.Rehnquist*.
(Perhaps the absence of state-level officials biases me away from states
rights).

!! Why?  A Bridge in Disrepair
!!! the document, living and dead

I propose that we regard our Constitution as vital infrastructure, a bridge
between the People and their Government.  Though infrastructure must be stable
to be reliable, we should not confuse stability with immutability, reverence
with repetition.  In the past half-century, we have more frequently observed
deadlocked brinksmanship in Congress.  Our faith in the Supreme Court has
eroded (whether in the Court's reading of Due Process in %Roe v Wade%, of Equal
Protection in %Bush v Gore%, of Freedom of Speech in %Citizens United vs FEC%,

or of Taxing and Spending in %NFIB v Sebelius%).  Yet, we've amended our
Constitution only twice in the past 50 years --- both times arguably
non-structurally.  We are failing to maintain our inheritance.

Several phenomena --- gerrymandering; the supreme court's high variance; the
continuity of government --- are phenomena that folks can agree are serious
problems and that we can decisively address only by amending our great
document.  Amendments need not advance one faction's interests while harming
over another's: we are far from a zero-sum regime.

!!! "nonpartisan" as a strict word
!!! nonpartisan adjustments abound
!!! a space of representative democracies

!! What?  New Democratic Recipes as Modern Infrastructure

!!! third ways in federalism and separation
Part of the Constitution's genius is its partitioning of power between national
and regional governments --- and, within each, between the judicial,
legislative, and executive branches.  (Of course, State constitutions add flesh
to the `republican form` clause).  Such separations inhibit the concentration
of power in a tyrant; they also offer the benefits of specialization and
modularity: cultural diversity between States is maintained, office holders may
be experts rather than jacks of all trades, and the People may replace the
specific office holders that disappoint them.

This, Scalia argues, is the Constitution's structural heart.  

!!!! independent state election boards
!!!! quasi-constitutional parameters
!!!! 

!!! gentle aggregations: budgeting

!!! chaos, or turn-taking?  randomness in the House

!!! keeping the tension: appointing a moderate Court

!! How?  Nucleation, Conventions, a Meta-Amendment
!!! what to overcome
!!! how to overcome it
!!! a sample meta-amendment

#-------  PART A : Multiple Paths to Amendment  -------------------------------
!!!! Section I : Multiple Paths to Amendment

The Congress or an Amending Convention may by sufficient majorities propose an
amendment to this Constitution.  Thereupon, the Legislature of each State shall
ratify or reject the amendment.  But if by 24 months of proposal that
Legislature rejects or fails to decide on the amendment, the People of that
State shall within an additional 24 months vote on the amendment, which shall
be ratified if (3/5)s of their votes so say.  If and only if within 48 months
of proposal (3/4)s of the States have ratified the amendment, the amendment
shall become part of this Constitution.

The Congress shall not propose an amendment without (2/3)s majorities in both
Chambers.  The Amending Convention shall not propose an amendment without
(2/3)s majorities in both unweighted and population-weighted senses.  When the
Amending Convention computes a population-weighted vote, each Delegate's Yea or
Nay shall be counted with multiplicity equal to the number of Representatives
to which their State is entitled in the Congress.  And no Amendment shall be
proposed that deprives a State, without its consent, of its equal suffrage in
the Senate.

#-------  PART B : Election and Duration of Convention  -----------------------
!!!! Section II : Election and Duration of Convention

In November of each 50th year, or of the earliest even year following the
simultaneous request of the executive authorities of (2/3)s of the States, an
Amending Convention shall begin.  To this Convention each State shall elect 2
Delegates from among candidates, qualified to run for Senator, running
specifically to become that State's Delegates.  Each voter may select any
subset of candidates in their State, and that pair of candidates that
intersects more voters' sets than any other pair shall be the State's
delegation.  The State's excutive authority shall fill vacancies as they arise.

The Amending Convention shall in the following January convene to draft and
debate amendments to this Constitution.  Within 24 months of convening, the
Convention shall conclude its work and shall have thus proposed zero, one, or
multiple amendments. Â At this time the Convention shall dissolve.

#-------  PART C : Procedure and Privileges in the Amending Convention  -------
!!!! Section III : Procedure and Privileges in the Amending Convention

The Convention shall by (unweighted) majorities adopt or revise their rules of
procedure and choose or replace their Director.  With the consent of an
unweighted majority the Director shall appoint administrative officers,
allocate general funds, and organize the Convention's deliberations.

The Congress shall by law supply to each Delegate: remuneration, assistants,
and funds comparable to those that a Senator annually enjoys; and to the
Convention: clerks, security, and funds comparable to those that the Senate
annually enjoys, and a physical convention hall befitting the occasion.

The Delegates shall in all cases, except treason, felony, and breach of the
peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance in the convention
hall, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any speech or
debate, they shall not be questioned in any other place.
