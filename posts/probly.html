about convex spaces and probability theory.

<h3>  Beyond Simplices: the Category $Conv$ </h3>
<p>
<h4>  The Category of Convex Spaces </h4>
<p>
<h5>  Probability Simplices </h5>
<p>
<p>
<h5>  Convex Spaces </h5>
<p>
    Intuitively, a <em>convex space</em> is a space closed under convex combinations.
Precisely, we consider a set $X$ equipped with a <em>mixture operation</em> $\mu:
\Delta_X \to X$ from the space $\Delta_X \triangleq \left\{ f:X\to\RR_{\geq 0}:
|\text{supp}(f)|\lt\infty\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\sum_x f(x)=1 \right\}$ of
formal finitary convex combinations of $X$'s elements to $X$.  We say that $X$
is a <em>convex space</em> provided that $\mu(x \mapsto \delta_{x,y}) = y$ for each
$y\in Y$ and that $ \mu(\sum_{i\in I} c_i f_i) = \mu(x \mapsto \sum_{i\in I}
c_i \delta_{x,\mu(f_i)}) $ for all finite $I$ and all sequences of $c_i\in
\RR_{\geq 0}$ and $f_i$ for which the two sides are defined.  Each valid $\mu$
is determined by its restriction to functions with size-$2$ support, so we will
sometimes conflate $\mu$ and this restriction, and for convenience we will
sometimes write $ \mu(x \mapsto \alpha \delta_{x,v} + (1-\alpha) \delta_{x,w})
\in X $ as $ \alpha v + (1-\alpha) w \in X $ when $v, w \in X$.
<p>
<h5>  Affine Morphisms </h5>
<p>
    The morphisms in the category of convex spaces are those that preserve
$\mu$.  More precisely, we observe that $\Delta$ is an endofunctor on the
category of Sets, and we declare the morphisms from $(X,\mu_X)$ to $(Y, \mu_Y)$
to be those functions $T:X \to Y$ such that $T \circ \mu_X = \mu_Y \circ
\Delta(T)$.  We have defined a category.  We could have defined the category
in fewer words --- as the <em>Eilenberge Moore category for $\Delta$</em> --- but we
choose here to be very concrete.
<p>
<h5>  Exotic Spaces </h5>
<p>
    Not every convex space is a subspace of some $\RR^n$.  A source of examples
comes from the semilattices, i.e. the posets $X$ with binary joins $\vee$: a
canonical mixture operation on $X$ is determined by is determined by the rule
$\alpha v + (1-\alpha) w \triangleq v \vee w$ as $v,w$ range through $X$ and
$\alpha$ ranges through $(0,1)$.  For example, say $X = \{\text{no},
\text{maybe}, \text{yes}\}$, where $\text{no},\text{yes}\lt\text{maybe}$.  Then
we have $(1/3) \text{no} + (2/3) \text{yes} = \text{maybe}$ and $(4/7)
\text{no} + (3/7) \text{maybe} = \text{maybe}$.  This is a space not of
<em>probabilities</em> but of <em>possibilities</em>!  Likewise, if $X = \{\text{zero},
\text{poly}, \text{exp}\}$ with $\text{zero}\lt\text{poly}\lt\text{exp}$, then
we have $(2/5) \text{zero} + (3/5) \text{poly} = \text{poly}$ and $(5/6)
\text{poly} + (1/6) \text{exp} = \text{exp}$: we have a space of <em>sizes</em>.

    I figured out this stuff by myself and for fun.
    As usual, I found out that others had thought of
    isomorphic ideas before me:
