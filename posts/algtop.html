<h3>  What is Algebraic Topology? </h3>
<h4>  Invariants Help Us Distinguish Spaces </h4>
    A classic technique for showing that two things are different is to demonstrate a property of
    one that doesn't hold for another.  For instance, this trick allows us to show that a circle
    and a real line are not homemorphic: one is compact, and the other isn't!  To show that one 
    circle is not homeomorphic to two circles, we can count
    connected components.  However, other distinctions require subtler tools to see.  No elementary
    topological property distinguishes a one-holed torus from a two-holed torus, for example.
    Instead of associating a truth-value or number with each space, it turns out in this case to be
    more fruitful to associate a <em>group</em>.  <b>Algebraic topology</b> is the study of such
    algebraically flavored topological invariants.
<p>
    Here is an informal example: again, consider the tori $T^{\#1}, T^{\#2}$ with one and
    two holes.  Then   
<p>
<h4>  Homotopy Equivalence </h4>
    We will investigate two invariants: the <b>fundamental group</b> and <b>singular homology</b>.  Both are
    preserved under not only homeomorphism but also <em>homotopy equivalence</em>.  It is easier for
    spaces to be homotopy equivalent than to be homeomorphic: the latter implies the former.  So
    the invariant technique cannot always distinguish nonhomeomorphic spaces.  The technique can't
    distinguish spaces that are too similar to each other, but when it <em>does</em> distinguish spaces,
    we know that they are <em>very</em> dissimilar.  Moreover, the invariants we will study are not even
    sufficient to reconstruct spaces up to homotopy equivalence.  This means two things: that we
    might still confuse very dissimilar spaces.  In other words, our tools cannot show that two
    spaces are <em>the same</em>, even for weak notions of "same".

<h4>  Algebraic Topology and Maps  </h4>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h4>  Why Do We Care When Spaces or Maps are Different? </h4>
    Here are three cool applications of FILL IN.
<p>
    <b>Theorem</b> (Brouwer): Every continuous map $f:D^n\to D^n$ on a closed ball has a fixed point.
<p>
    <b>Theorem</b> (Poincare): Every continuous vector field on $S^{2n}$ has a $0$.
<p>
    <b>Theorem</b> (Gauss): Every complex polynomial is constant or has a root.
<p>
    <b>Theorem</b>: Every subgroup of a free group is free.

<h3>  The Fundamental Group </h3>
<h4>  The Fundamental Set </h4>
    For a space $X$, consider the continuous maps $:X\from S^1$.  Recall that two such maps $f,g$
    are <em>homotopic</em> when there is some continuous interpolator $h:X\from [0,1]\times S^1$ such that
    $h_0=f$ and $h_1=g$.  This is clearly an equivalence relation.  The resulting equivalence
    classes we will call <em>loops</em> in $X$.  The set $F(X)$ of loops is X's <em>fundamental set</em>. 
<p>
    For instance, $F(S^1)$ is infinite, while $F(\RR)$ is finite of size $1$.  Since $F$ is clearly
    invariant under homeomorphism, this provides another proof that $S^1$ and $\RR$ are not
    homeomorphic.
<p>
    Likewise, $F(S^2)$ is finite of size $1$, while $F(S^1\times S^1)$ is infinite.  This shows
    that the sphere and torus are not homeomorphic.  
<p>
    However, $F(T^{\#1})$ and $F(T^{\#2})$ are both countably infinite.  We need a finer invariant 
    to distinguish them.
<p>
    Before we do so, let's think about the fundamental set.  First, it is a functor from Top to
    Set.  It acts on morphisms in the natural way: if $s:X\from Y$ is continuous,
    then $F(s)$ sends the loop $f:Y\from S^1$ to the loop $s\circ f:X\from S^1$.    
<p>
    Thus, injections map to injections, so $S^1$ is not a deformation retract of the disk $D^2$. 
<p>
    Visualize in terms of torus.  View as generalization of path connected components.
    While path-connectedness is preserved by continuous maps, simple-connectedness is not.
<p>
<h3>  The Fundamental Group </h3>
    To obtain a more powerful invariant, we needn't look far.  The idea is to consider
    relationships between loops, thus imposing further structure on the Fundamental Set.  In fact,
    we will modify our definitions slightly to allow <em>composition</em> of loops, yielding the
    Fundamental Group.  We can consider loops as paths when we fix a basepoint $\star\in S^1$.
    Then, if $f,g:X\from S^1$ are loops with $f(\star)=g(\star)$, we can compose the loops into
    $(fg):X\from S^1$ using the homotopy class of maps $:S^1\wedge S^1\from S^1$.  
<p>
    However, the  
<p>
Let's begin with the fundamental group.  This is a covariant functor from the
category of <em> pointed topological spaces </em> to the category of groups.
