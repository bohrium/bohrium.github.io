<h2>  Boundary Axioms for Topology  </h2>
    Can we axiomatize point-set topology in terms of topological boundaries rather than open or closed sets?  We
    describe such a formulation, invented with Dean Young, Noah Luntzlara, Eric Winsor, Leo Izen, and Brian Pinsky.
<p>
    We later learned of previous work by Lesniak [0].  Lesniakâ€™s Example 2 shows the forward and backward
    correspondences developed here not to be bijective.  In particular, our axiom set is missing the logically
    independent $ddU \subseteq dU$ necessary to make unique the boundary operator associated with a topological
    space.  We nevertheless present topology from a boundary point of view, for whatever insight it may give.
<p>
<h3>  Introduction </h3>
<p>
    As scientists studying space, we might begin with this observation: a region of space has an inside and an outside
    separated by a boundary.  What can we say then, about boundaries?  We note that space on whole has empty boundary:
    space is entirely inside with no outside.  Moreover, a region and its complement have the same boundary.
<p>
    Yet, those observations fail to capture the essence of a boundary as a thin tissue separating a region and its
    complement. We express this essence by considering the boundary of an intersection.  As we see in Figure 0, the
    boundary of the depicted intersection is a union of three terms, akin to the product rule for finite differences:
        $$d(ab) = dab + adb + dadb$$
    Let us collect our intuitions into a definition:
<p>
    <b>Definition</b>: A map $d: \mathcal{P}T\from \mathcal{P}T$ on a set $T$ is a <b>boundary operator</b> provided that,
    for all $U, V \subseteq T$:
        $T$ has no boundary: $dT = \{\}$;
        $d$ is symmetric: $d(T \ U) = dU$; and
        $d$ obeys the product rule: $d(UV) \subseteq dUV \cup U dV \cup dU dV$
<p>
<figure style="text-align:center"><img src="../images/boundary/prod.png" alt="Figure 0: Product Rule"></figure><figcaption style="text-align:center">Figure 0: Product Rule</figcaption>
<p>
    We then call T a boundary space. Here, we concatenate to denote intersection: $UV = U \cap V$.
    If $T$ is a topological space, its topology can be recovered from its boundary structure:
<p>
    <b>Definition</b>:  If $T$ is a boundary space and $U\subseteq T$, then we call $U$ <em>boundless</em> when $dU=\{\}$;
    <em>open</em> when $dU \subseteq T\setminus U$, and <em>closed</em> when $dU \subseteq U$.
<p>
    The boundless sets are precisely the open closed sets.  Our main result is a correspondence between boundary
    spaces and topological spaces:
<p>
    <b>Theorem</b>: The open sets of a boundary space form a topology, and the standard boundary map of a
    topological space is a boundary operator.
<p>
<p>
<h3>  Continuity, Connectedness, Compactness </h3>
    A map $f:S \from T$ between boundary spaces is <em>continuous</em> when $df^{-1} \subseteq df^{-1}$ as maps $:\mathcal{S}\to\mathcal{T}$. 
    This corresponds to the topological notion of continuity: if $U$ is open, i.e. $dU \subseteq S\setminus U$, then
    $df^{-1}(U) \subseteq f^{-1}(S\setminus U) = T\setminus f^{-1}(U)$, so $f^{-1}(U)$ is open.    
<p>
    A boundary space $T$ is <em>connected</em> when no nonempty proper subset have empty boundaries. 
<p>
    A boundary space $T$ is <em>compact</em> when any
