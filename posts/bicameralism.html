<h2>  Stronger Bicameralism </h2>
<p>
(This essay concerns some of the constitutional changes proposed in

<a href="./constitution-250.html">A Sci-Fi Constitution</a>.)
<p>
We Americans<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160except Ben Franklin and Nebraskans in their eccentric wisdom</span></span>
celebrate our bicameral system.  When working at its best, it protects
individual rights by requiring broad national consensus before allowing our
out-of-state neighbors from disabling the old rules that protect us, or from
making new rules we have to follow.  The measure of broad consensus is whether
three different bodies (House, Senate, President) --- elected in three
different manners on three different timescales according to three different
spatial slicings-up of the country --- ALL agree that a proposed change helps
more than harms.
<p>
To enhance this requirement of consensus, we might lean into the individual
characters of the Congress's two Chambers.  The ideal fairy tale goes like
this: the House is a hot melting pot of diverse and zany passions, the stage
for the People's grand polyphony; the Senate, a cool deliberator where even the
less powerful States can claim a voice.  I propose to strengthen bicameralism
by making the fairy tale a bit more true.
<p>
<h3>  The Senate </h3>
<p>
The 17th Amendment was proposed and ratified in response to rampant corruption:
State legislators in essence put Senate seats for sale.  But the 17th
Amendment's spirit, one of anti-corruption-via-popular-vote, can be preserved
while also enhancing protections of local democracy: simply allow the State
legislators to prepare the menu of candidates from which the People choose.
Two desiderata: (A) even a lopsided legislature should produce a diverse menu,
and (B) even if a majority of legislators are bribable and bribed, the menu
should contain one or more "clean" candidates.
<p>
We kill two birds by letting minority groups of legislators nominate
candidates.  Let any group of, say, 1/5 of the State legislators<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160The original
Article I gives precedent for the U.S.  Constitution breaking encapsulation to
depend on the membership structure of individual State Legislatures.</span></span> nominate
one candidate, with no one belonging to multiple groups.  Then the People by
<b>single transferable vote</b><sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160In this system, each voter ranks one or more
candidates (1st, 2nd, etc).  We'll do steps of elimination, so as useful
shorthand let's say a candidate is at some step a voter's "favorite" when the
voter ranks the candidate as best among un-eliminated candidates.  The system
is: SO LONG AS MULTIPLE CANDIDATES REMAIN, ELIMINATE THE CANDIDATE WHO IS THE
FEWEST VOTERS' FAVORITE.  (The remaining candidate wins.)  Crucially, though
candidates are eliminated, ballots are not: if my first choice got eliminated,
then my ballot still matters in favoring my second choice over my third choice
etc.</span></span> select a winner.
<p>
Under a two party system, unless a legislature is 80-percent Blue or 80-percent
Red, there will be at least one candidate from each major party.  In fact,
since SingleTransferableVote does not have major "spoiler" effects, we expect 4
candidates.  Say a State's pro-Banana caucus, which originally would have
nominated a certain pro-Banana candidate (who peels from the stem), is big
enough that by splitting it could nominate two candidates.  The half of those
pro-Banana legislators who are sympathetic to a different pro-Banana candidate
(who peels from the tip) would not jeopardize the pro-Banana cause if they
split off to nominate that candidate; so we'd get two meaningfully different
pro-Banana candidates.
Legislators who want to avoid appearing complicit in narrowing voters' choices
to just 2 --- a complaint apparently common among voters both Red and Blue ---
and legislators whose ideas and emphases differ, even slightly, from the exact
median preference of their party --- would be incentivized to increase the menu
size.  For this reason, there'd typically be 4 candidates.
<p>
Moreover, the SingleTransferableVote tends to reward moderation and civility.
Mudslinging toward another candidate has the cost of worsening one's ranking on
the ballots of those who like that candidate.  Say the anti-Bananas are
sufficiently more popular than the pro-Bananas so that it is a given that an
anti-Banana will win; if the anti-Bananas are divided between one extreme and
one moderate candidate, then the pro-Banana voters' rankings will tip the
balance in favor of the moderate candidate.  Result: a moderate anti-Banana
candidate.
<p>
As for bribery: under the original Article I, a mere majority of (upper house)
legislators could sell Senate seats; but in the typical multiple-groups
scenario, unless 4/5ths of the legislators succumb to bribery, the people would
have at least one "clean" candidate to choose.  And since such bribery when it
happens would be less effective, it would probably happen less to begin with.
<p>
The proposed change, in line with the 17th Amendment, has the People choose
their Senator; moreover, the choice would, under our current two-party system,
have the richness of primary elections in addition to general elections.  The
key difference is that it is subgroups of State legislators, rather than the
local branches (and the primaries they have so much power over) of naion-wide
Parties with national platforms, that select the menu.  Thus, these candidates
would tend to be more sympathetic to effecting the policies of the People ---
whether these be Blue or Red policies --- via State government rather than
National government.
<p>
The 1/5 threshold could have been any smallish fraction.  I chose it for
aesthetic unity.  For, the smallest constant fraction that the old-and-actual
Constitution mentions is 1/5: a minority of Senators or Representatives of that
size may force the presentation (through their respective Chamber's journal) of
information to the People.  This lax threshold for information-flow to the
People resonates with the proposed process by which State legislators recommend
candidates to the People.
<p>
<h3>  The House </h3>
<p>
To amplify the House's direct and fiery character, one would want a voting
system that <b>FIXES GERRYMANDERING</b>, and, more strongly, that is
Concentration-Unswayed, i.e., that represents each minority no matter their
geographic concentration.  To illustrate, imagine two worlds: in World A, one
third of all districts are entirely Star-Bellied, and the remaining districts
are entirely Plain-Bellied.  In World B, every single district is one-third
Star-Bellied and two-thirds Plain-Bellied.  The Star-Bellies should, of course,
have one third of the House in World A.  What I mean by Concentration-Unswayed
is that the Star-Bellies should enjoy the same House representation in the two
worlds.  A Concentration-Unswayed voting system would, because it is impervious
to gerrymandering and for other reasons, amplify the House's ideal character.
<p>
Yet, of the many Concentration-Unswayed voting systems, the better-known ones
tend to rely on non-local representation.  But Local representation is our
American way.  Your Representative's job<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160unless you're in Puerto Rico or D.C.
or a minor Territory; I'm sorry.</span></span> is to represent you whether or not you voted
for them, and likewise for all in your neighborhood.  This softly rules out
voting systems that enlarge our (already large) districts into multi-member
districts or that, folding in our centuries-long resistance against pure
factionalism, recognize Parties rather than People as the fundamental electable
unit.<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160One could maintain locality for these methods by radically enlarging or
time-splitting the House or by complicated methods whereby local candidates
affiliate with national parties that in turn rank their affiliates, so that,
earning by global vote a budget of seats, their ranking and budget together
determine which of their affiliates win --- hence the word "softly".</span></span>
<p>
So, to get a Concentration-Unswayed, Local voting system seems to require some
<b>TURN-TAKING</b>: I, Star-Bellied, agree with my two Plain-Bellied neighbors that
I will get my candidate this election and they will get theirs in the next two.
Making a table of who agrees with whom, we schedule which subgroups control
which of the next several elections.  Now, this is horribly complicated,
especially as folks move within and between States; worse --- and this is a
fundamental flaw if we seek democracy --- this remember-a-past-table method
does not accomodate people who over time change their mind!  We seek a system
that is Memoryless.
<p>
Fortunately, there is a way out --- a very simple system that is simultaneously
Concentration-Unswayed, Local, and Memoryless.  In this system, the lifetime
experience of a citizen (one engaged enough to vote) in their more than two
dozen House elections, would be, if, say, they happen to be always in a
minority of size one-third, that in close to one third of those elections their
favored candidate wins.  If half of the time they are in a minority of
size-one-third minority and the other half in a size-two-thirds majority, then
in close to half of their lifetime elections their favorite candidate will win.
And so forth.
<p>
The system is this: select each election's winner with probability
<em>proportional to votes received</em>, that is, randomly.  With dice as our
turn-taking mechanism, no memory is needed.
<p>
We, unlike 250 years ago, are a numerate nation.  To the worry that "Whoever
controls the dice controls the outcome" we may answer that the metaphorical die
roll shall be the joint responsibility of the election's candidates, by any of
the many methods of randomness-aggregation, relying on basic arithmetic, that
are not just fair but in fact <b>to-the-public-verifiably fair</b>.  Such systems
have the properties that: (A) they generate randomness that will then by a
deterministic process be used to threshold election counts, so that recounts
can be performed with no problem; (B) unless the candidates unanimously
conspire to cheat in a coordinated way, then the resulting die rolls are truly
fair (example: if at least one candidate doesn't cheat, or if all Blue
candidates cheat together and all Red candidates cheat together, but these two
groups do not collaborate, then the resulting die rolls are truly fair); (C)
ordinary members of the public, with pen and paper and spare weekend, or with a
computer and a spare minute, can via basic arithmetic verify that an election
outcome was fair, again assuming there is no unanimous conspiracy.
<p>
<p>
<p>
It would be understandable if one feels anxious about turn-taking.  Something
feels <em>unfair</em> about a 60-percent majority getting their way only 60-percent of
the time, and in particular perhaps not getting their way this year!  Here
again, the facilitation via randomness of turn-taking establishes formal
properties to assuage our worry.  Key is that turns are uncorrelated between
distinct districts.  Switching viewpoint from that of single voters across all
their years to that of single years across all their voters, we see by "Laws of
Large Numbers" that the House in every year will have nearly proportional
representation.  How nearly?  Say that about 50-percent of voters<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160weighted, as
usual, by voter engagement and by the ratio of each State's seats in the House
to its population</span></span> vote for the Star-Bellied cause.  Then we expect with
probability 95-percent (i.e., with exceptions only every forty years) less than
4.7 percentage-points of deviation from this quantity.
For comparison, this once-in-forty-year deviation under the turn-taking system
is a bit smaller than the current system's typical deviation of 6.3
percentage-points over the past 20
years.<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160"6.3 percentage-points" is a root-mean-square, over 10 elections, of
the difference between national House representation fractions and national
voting fractions, and counting only the two major parties.  Our computation of
national voting fraction differs from a simple national sum-of-votes in two
ways: (a) we normalize away voter engagement, so a district has the same weight
whether its voters submitted 1000 or 100000 ballots, and (b) each district has
the same weight; e.g.  Delaware-at-large (population 1.0 million) and
Wyoming-at-large (population 0.6 million) both have weight one.  We count
candidates who officially affiliate with Democrats or Republicans, and no
others.  When an election has multiple candidates of the same party, we sum their votes.
We merge all parties with "Democrat" in their name (e.g. Minnesota's DFL), and
analogously with "Republican" (no party counts as both).  I used

<a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/data">the MIT election lab's data</a>.</span></span>
<p>
We could eliminate very unpopular candidates by imposing a threshold before
consideration for turn-taking.  This may assuage fears of some Horrible Fascist
Minority gaining a few seats among the House's many hundreds.  Such fear is the
typical anti-populist fear that is the bass line to the praise, which Blue
voters give during Red eras and Red voters give during Blue eras, of indirect
democracy with checks and balances.  And indeed, not just the moat between "few
seats" and "a majority of seats" but also our bicameral system (the House by
itself cannot make law) give strong answer to the fear.  Still, requiring a low
threshold does little to erode the benefits listed and may calm the anxious
mind.  So we pick a fraction --- as in our discussion of the Senate, 1/5 has
among various small fractions the benefit of aesthetic unity.  Another way it
phrase it is: if your candidate is so unpopular that it'd take longer on
average than the time between censuses for their turn to come, then they are
too unpopular to be considered.  This is because 5 House elections occur
between consecutive censuses.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h3>  Overall </h3>
<p>
Zooming out to our Bicameral theme: each seat of the House is a stage for
expression, not wise consensus.  We further this ideal via
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">MemorylessTurnTaking</span>, which fixes gerrymandering, and due to LawOfLargeNumbers
faithfully reflects the electorate's makeup, and gives voice to minorities ---
those we strongly agree with and those we strongly disagree with.  Meanwhile,
the Senate is the great moderator.  We further this ideal by <span style="font-variant: small-caps">GroupNomination</span>
and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">SingleTransferableVote</span>, the first installing a subtle moderating force
toward State autonomy and the second a mechanism that helps moderate candidates
--- those that unexcitingly unite supermajorities rather than intensely dazzle
mere pluralities --- to win.
<p>
This pair of changes to how Representatives and Senators are elected has the
pleasant property of political balance, for, as I gather, proportional House
representation is considered a Blue cause, and State influence over the Senate
a Red one.  (Aside: to be honest, I don't understand why.  Gerrymandering<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160by
which e.g. Maryland has hurt Red voters and North Carolina has hurt Blue
voters, such effects

<a href="https://isps.yale.edu/news/blog/2023/06/partisan-gerrymandering-mostly-cancels-out-at-national-level-study-shows">by some metrics roughly canceling nationally</a></span></span> hurts both
Blue and Red voters and, more importantly, should offend the republican
sensibilities of every American.  As for the Senate as protector of local
democratic self-government: #among the small States there are both many Blue
and many Red States and, more importantly, the erosion of the power of States
to self-regulate<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160e.g. Blue voters may object that 2005's PLCAA enfeebles local
democratic regulation of guns, or that judges confirmed by a modern Senate may,
in interpreting the Comstock Act, prevent local democratic processes from
ensuring abortion pill access; meanwhile, Red voters may object that 2010's ACA
disables local democratic processes from determining how to balance the health
of children against other costly projects</span></span> has in this century been negatively
felt and much protested by both the Red and the Blue.)
<p>
Summary:
<p>
<b>ELECTION TO THE SENATE</b> --- The State Legislature shall, in the May before the
election, nominate a number of candidates, with any group of one fifth of its
legislators duly sworn permitted to nominate one candidate; but no two groups
shall overlap.  And from these candidates, the people of the State shall by
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">SingleTransferableVote</span> elect their Senator.  That is: each voter shall rank
one or more candidates, and so long as multiple candidates remain, that
candidate shall be eliminated who is, according to the voters' rankings of the
candidates yet un-eliminated, the first choice of the fewest voters; the
remaining candidate shall win.
<p>
<b>ELECTION TO THE HOUSE</b> --- The people of the State shall by
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">MemorylessTurnTaking</span> elect their Representatives.  That is: the State
Legislature having determined one district for each seat, each voter shall
select one candidate; the district's winner shall be chosen, from among the
plurality candidate and all candidates receiving one fifth of all votes, with
probability proportional to votes received, and this randomness shall be
independent of all other elections.
<p>
<p>
<h3>  Appendix: Verifiably Fair Generation of Randomness </h3>
<p>
Here I'll explain how to craft a VerifiablyFair protocol by which several
candidates in an election can jointly "roll a die" so as to pick a winner with
probability proportional to number of votes received.
<p>
<h4>  First a word on Recounts </h4>
<p>
First, momentarily putting aside the issue of fairness, how can "die rolls"
pick a winner?  One way is to stack the ballots in alphabetical order --- first
come all the ballots that mark "Alice", then all those that mark "Bob", and so
forth.  Next, randomly uniformly choose a number \(x\) between \(0.0\) and
\(1.0\), and select the ballot that is a fraction \(x\) of the way from the
start of the stack to the end: the candidate marked by that stack wins.  Since
each ballot is equally likely to be selected, the candidates have
winning-chance proportional to the votes they receive, as desired.<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160Since we
imagined the ballots as stacked alphabetically, we don't have to actually
physically stack them: it's easy to figure out what the outcome <em>would be</em> if
we did stack them, based on \(x\) and on the election tallies; also, if a
recount is called, we just use the same \(x\) together with the modified
election tallies.  Unless \(x\) originally landed very close to one of the
liminal ballots between one candidate's part of the stack and another, or
unless the recount drastically changes the tallies, the recount will not change
the winner.</span></span>
<p>
Now, how do use "die rolls" to choose \(x\)?  Well, just as we can use two
rolls of a \(10\)-sided die to get a number up to a hundred, we can use six
rolls to uniformly randomly select one of the million numbers between \(0.0\)
and \(1.0\) with six digit after the decimal place.  As this resolution is more
than enough for practical purposes, our task is reduced to VerifiablyFairly
performing a joint roll of a \(10\)-sided die.
<p>
<h4>  Reminders about how digits and sums work </h4>
<p>
 TODO
<p>
<h4>  Hashes </h4>
<p>
Say you've made an astonishing scientific discovery, but being a jealous and
secretive person want to sit on it for a while before announcing it, perhaps to
get a head-start building on it.  Yet if you don't announce immediately, you
worry that someone else will discovery the same, then by announcing their
discovery will appear in the public eye to have scooped you.  What should you
do about this dilemma?
<p>
The 17th century solution of Hooke, Newton, and others was this: to announce a
an <em>anagram</em> of a description of the discovery.  The anagram was
pretty hard to unscramble, so announcing it did not jeopardize the secret.  But if
a priority dispute arose, then the discoverer could reveal the original
(unscrambled) description; though it was hard to unscramble the anagram, it was
easy to check if any purported decoding was authentic.  This is how these petty
geniuses secured priority.
<p>
In modern times, we have better versions of the same scheme.  Two problems<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160
A third problem is that the description of the discovery was sometimes quite
vague, potentially amplifying problem (B); but this is neither here nor there.
</span></span>
with anagrams of short latin sentences that Hooke et al used to describe their
discoveries: (A) with large but plausible effort and luck somebody <em>could</em>
unscramble the anagram, leaking the secret; (B) a "discoverer" could
potentially contrive some super-flexible anagram<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160probably with lots of vowels
and common consonants</span></span> to be "unscrambled" post hoc to any of a large range of
descriptions.  Basic arithmetic on large numbers helps us address both (A) and
(B).
<p>
For example, there are fast algorithms for generating random prime numbers of a
given number of digits.  Generate two \(1000\)-digit prime numbers \(p\) and
\(q\), then set \(n=p\cdot{}q\), their product.  From the product \(n\) alone,
it is very very hard to figure out \(p\) and \(q\) --- brute force, using a
classical computer the size of the earth, would still require much much more
time than the age of the universe.  This will help us address (A).  Yet by high
school facts about factorization, there is only one answer:
\(p\cdot{}q=q\cdot{}p=n\) and no other pair of integers-at-least-two multiplies
to \(n\).  This will help us address (B).
<p>
To put this to work, say that the "secret" we want to create an "anagram" for
is some \(500\)-digit number \(s\).  Appending to \(s\) a random
\(100\) digits to get \(s^\prime\), and generating \(p\) and \(q\) (say
for definiteness \(p\) is smaller), we announce both \(n=p\cdot{}q\) and the
last \(600\) digits of \(p+s^\prime\).
That's a mouthful, but the point is that (A) from the announced data we
can't<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160There are technically much better
examples of the kind of "modern anagram" we are discussing --- examples we have
even more faith are computationally intractable even by quantum computers ---
but we'll stick with this example for simplicity.</span></span>
figure out \(s\); and (B) that from a further announcement (of \(n\) and a
purported \(s\)) the public can verify whether the purported \(s\) coincides
with the original \(s\).
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h4>  Illustrations </h4>
<p>
<b>ILLUSTRATION I</b> --- To jointly roll a \(10\)-sided die, each candidate, prior
to election, privately records a random digit (0 thru 9), sealing their digit
in an envelope to be stored in the public trust.  After election, the envelopes
are unsealed and the joint outcome is defined as the last digit of the sum
of the candidates' digits.
<p>
<b>ANALYSIS OF ILLUSTRATION I</b> --- The good case is where each candidate
generates their private digit by actually random means, perhaps by rolling
their own \(10\)-sided die.  It's obvious that in this good case, the outcome
is a uniformly random digit.
<p>
What's neat is that even with huge amounts of bad faith, the outcome is still a
uniformly random digit.  The two key properties are (A) that any one
candidate's choice of digit can arbitrarily change the joint outcome and (B)
that each candidate's choice , being private, affects neither the choices of
other candidates or the ballots of the People.  What guarantees (A) is that any
digit can be gotten (as an answer's last digit) from any digit by adding the
appropriate digit.  What guarantees (B) is that the choices were made privately
before the election, using the envelopes as a "commitment scheme".
<p>
For example, suppose the candidate Xavier is ganged up on by a conspiracy of
all the other candidates.  Since Xavier is late in the alphabet, the other
candidates conspire to try to make the joint outcome small, close to 0 rather
than 9.  But if Xavier generates his digit by actually rolling a die, then no
matter what the conspiracy does in response (which can't depend on the actual
roll, by (B)) the joint outcome will be uniformly random (at root by (A)).
Moreover, Xavier is by winning chances dis-incentivized from choosing an even
somewhat-predictable digit; for, if Xavier indulged some non-random
tendency (perhaps to choose his favorite number 7) then the conspiracy could
exploit that tendency (in this case by choosing 3, so that the joint outcome is
0).  That is, even if Xavier isn't intrinsically invested in good-faith
behavior, so long as he does not cooperate with the conspiracy against him: the
outcome will be uniformly random.<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160Similar analyses establish
the same outcome when, for instance, every candidate belongs to some conspiracy
(perhaps there is a big Red conspiracy and a big Blue conspiracy), so long as
these conspiracies are disconnected.  The key tool in such analyses is the
assumption that each candidate works rationally toward some goal (which does
not need to be related to that candidate winning), and what justifies this
assumption in practice is that in this "game of multiple added dice", rational
behavior isn't trick or complicated to discern.</span></span> Through more general analyses
of the same kind, we find that: <b>Unless the candidates unanimously conspire,</b>
the outcome will be a uniformly random digit.<b></b>
<p>
... Now, Illustration I generates just one digit, but we can use the same idea
to generate many random digits ...
<p>
<b>ILLUSTRATION II</b> --- To generate \(1000\) random digits, each candidate
privately records a random \(1000\)-digit sequence in an envelope to be stored
in the public trust.<sup><span class="gray">&#9679</span></sup><span class="aside"><span class="asideinner"><span class="gray">&#9679</span>&#160Practically, to save four hours of tedium, a trusted
computer-saavy member of the campaign team does this by computer.</span></span> After
election, the envelopes are unsealed and the joint outcome is defined as the
last \(1000\) digits of the sum of the candidates' sequences, regarded as
numbers.
<p>
<p>
... Illustration II generates fair randomness but not verifiably fair
randomness.  The public can watch on TV how the envelopes were deposited, kept
safe, and drawn out, but this is still a bit dissatisfying.  How would a
controversy be resolved in which a candidate claims their envelope's entries
were tampered with?  We can use the HASHING idea mentioned above to replace
physical envelopes by a verifiably fair mechanism. ...
<p>
<b>ILLUSTRATION III</b> --- To generate \(1000\) random digits, each candidate
privately records a random \(1000\)-digit sequence.  Each candidate publicly
announces a "hash" of their sequence, such that from the hash alone the
sequence cannot be inferred and such that  the public may, by comparing against
the hash, check whether any purported sequence is the same as the actual
sequence.  After election, the candidates announce their private sequences, and
the joint outcome is defined as the last \(1000\) digits of the sum of the
candidates' sequences, regarded as numbers, counting only those sequences
that, as checked against the hashes, were faithful.
<p>
