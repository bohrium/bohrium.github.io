<h3>  Part A: Similarities to Euclidean Space </h3>
<h4>  Epsiode  0: Introduction </h4>
    The old joke goes that a topologist can't distinguish a donut and a coffee mug.  Thus stem the
    durable, meaty invariants of topology.  At the same time, one feels that there <b>is</b> some
    interesting difference between the two breakfast items.  For instance, we know that 
    a unit sphere encloses the most volume for a fixed surface area; which shapes achieve the same
    among those diffeomorphic to a torus?  Or, imagine we are infinitesimal ants walking
    geodesically on a donut and on a coffee mug.  For certain shapes as sketched below, we may
    observe two drastically different behaviors: on a donut, the ant <b>always</b> traces a dense path;
    on a mug, it <b>never</b> does!
<p>
    But, while the introduction of geometric structure leads us to ask about the structure
    itself, we may also step back and wonder how geometry and topology relate.  Whenever we have a pair
    of notions, one more abstract and one more concrete, we may investigate all the ways a given
    abstract object may be realized concretely (if at all); which properties of a concrete object
    determine certain properties of its abstraction; and vice versa.  Examples of pairs include
    groups and their representations, manifolds and their euclidean embeddings, set theories and
    their models, and topologies and their metrics.  Here, we shall wonder:
    <b>what can geometry tell us about topology</b>?
<p>
    In short, we are interested in volumes, lengths, and angles.
    After all: sometimes, size matters.
<p>
    In these notes, we will develop the basic language, techniques, and examples of
    <b>Differential Geometry</b>, this subject of lengths and angles on smooth manifolds.  Eventually, we
    will discuss statements such as
    "Every complete manifold of curvature bounded below by some positive $\delta$ is compact" and
    "Every complete simply connected manifold of negative curvature is diffeomorphic to $\RR^n$".
    We will end by sketching applications to einsteinian gravity, statistics, computer vision, and
    geology. 
<p>
<h5>  $\fbox{CURVATURE}$  </h5>
    Curvature will be a central quantity of study.  Let's develop intuition by considering some
    low-dimensional manifolds embedded into Euclidean space; the distance between two points on
    a manifold we understand as the infimum of lengths of paths between them.  First, observe
    that curves in $\RR^2$ are all locally isometric --- just parameterize by arclength. 
    Therefore, though two immersions may have osculating circles of different radii (and hence
    may have different extrinsic curvatures), all curves have the <em>same</em> intrinsic curvature.
<p>
    INSERT IMAGE
<p>
    Second, consider surfaces in $\RR^3$.  Instead of osculating circles, we now have osculating
    ellipsoids (and hyperboloids)!  Thus, the extrinsic curvatures are described by <em>two</em> radii,
    not one.  When considering what is preserved by isometries of a surface, we find that one
    degree of freedom dies (for instance, observe that a plane and cylinder are locally isometric
    because it is possible to roll paper without bending it), and one degree of freedom remains.
    Therefore, even locally, not all surfaces are equivalent!
<p>
    INSERT IMAGE
<p>
    Equipped with this intuitive image of a surface's curvature, several questions become natural:
    Are the aforementioned theorems true?  Is every simply connected constant positive curvature
    manifold a sphere?  What if we allow "small" perturbations away from constant?  Is every
    orientable compact manifold of positive curvature simply connected?  Given curvature
    information, can we relate a compact connected manifold's fundamental group to its metric
    structure?  But we must precisely define curvature before addressing these questions.  We begin
    with a review of manifolds:
<p>
<h5>  $\fbox{SMOOTH MANIFOLDS}$  </h5>
    It is well to define a topological manifold semi-intrinsically as a topological space
    (second-countable and Hausdorff) locally homeomorphic to (open subsets of) some $\RR^n$.  In so
    doing, we rely on a prior notion of general topological structure.  However, we have no
    analogue for general smooth structure.  Thus, we work extrinsically: a <b>smooth manifold</b> of
    dimension $n$ is a family of bijections $\{\phi_i:X_i\to U_i\subseteq \RR^n\}_{i\in I}$ where
    each $U_i\subseteq \RR^n$ is open.  The bijections must obey a gluing axiom: for all
    $i, j\in I$, the map $\phi_i\circ \phi_j|_{\phi_j(X_i\cap X_j)}$ between real open sets is
    <em>smooth</em>.  These "transition maps" will hence be diffeomorphisms and so
    $M = \bigcup_{i\in I} X_i$ will also be a topological manifold (with the second countable and
    Hausdorff assumptions always implicit).  Beware: topological manifolds may have 0, 1, or
    more smooth structures.  Typical examples:
    $S^n, \RR P^n=S^n/(\ZZ/2\ZZ), \CC P^n=S^{2n+1}/U(1)$; Lie Groups such as
    $(S^1)^n, SO(n), SU(n)$; compact surfaces $((S^1)^2)^{\#n}, (\RR P^2)^{\#n}$.
<p>
    DG relies on derivatives, and derivatives act on vectors.  Think of $T_p M$ as a vectorspace of
    velocities.  We recall 3 definitions: derivations of germs; equivalence classes of pointed
    curves; coherent assignments $v_i\in T_{\phi_i(p)U_i}$ of vectors in $T\RR^n$.  The first deals
    with maps $:M\to \RR$; the middle with maps $:\RR\to M$; and the last with local
    diffeomorphisms $M \leftrightarrow \RR^n$ --- each view has contexts of use.  The last
    viewpoint allows us to consider a local (trivial) tangent bundle $\bigsqcup_{p\in V} T_p M$ as
    a smooth manifold itself.  Gluing, we obtain a (nontrivial) bundle $TM \twoheadrightarrow M$
    between smooth manifolds.  $\dim(TM) = 2n$.
<p>
<h5>  $\fbox{METRIC STRUCTURE}$  </h5>
    Finally, metric structure.  We wish to consider metrics $d: M^2\to [0, \infty]$ that agree with
    a manifold's smooth structure.  Specifically, our metrics must: (a) agree with topology; (b)
    have locally smooth squares $d^2|_{U^2}$; and (c) induce <b>length spaces</b>, that is, obey
    $$d(a, b) = \inf_{a=c_0, \cdots, c_m=b} \sum_{0\leq i\lt m} d(c_i, c_{i+1})$$
<p>
    For example, the unit circle $S^1$ has a metric (given by arclength) that obeys the above.  In
    this case, $d^2$ is not globally smooth: it is not differentiable when evaluated at antipodal
    points.  However, $d^2$ is locally smooth.  Moreover, because distance is defined in terms of 
    the length of paths, the length space condition is also met. 
<p>
    INSERT IMAGE
<p>
    This consideration of paths leads us to seek a local characterization of a manifold's metric
    structure.  This is given by the <b>metric tensor</b> $g_p$, a bilinear map on each $T_p M$ defined
    by $2 g_p(v, w) = v(w(q \mapsto d^2(p, q)))$.  The main properties of $g$, to be checked next
    time, are that it is an inner product, that $g_p$ varies suitably smoothly in $p$, and that
    from $g_p$, which gives local geometric information, we can recover $d$ on any connected
    component.
