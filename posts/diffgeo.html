<h3>  Part A: Similarities to Euclidean Space </h3>
<h4>  Lecture  0: Introduction  </h4>
    Let us study the geometry of smooth manifolds.  While differential topology illuminates global
    shape via local calculus, we will understand global shape via local metric notions.  For
    example, the Hopf Index Theorem, which equates a manifold's Euler Characteristic to its vector
    fields' shared total index, exemplifies DT.  By contrast, we will show statements such as
    "Every complete manifold of curvature bounded below by some positive $\delta$ is compact" and
    "Every complete simply connected manifold of negative curvature is diffeomorphic to $\RR^n$".
    Here, curvature and completeness are concepts defined in terms of a manifold's metric structure.
<p>
<h5>  $\fbox{CURVATURE}$  </h5>
    Curvature will be a central quantity of study.  Let's develop intuition by considering some
    low-dimensional manifolds embedded into Euclidean space; the distance between two points on
    a manifold we understand as the infima of lengths of paths between them.  First, observe
    that curves in $\RR^2$ are all locally isometric --- just parameterize by arclength. 
    Therefore, though two immersions may have osculating circles of different radii (and hence
    may have different extrinsic curvatures), all curves have the <em>same</em> intrinsic curvature.
<p>

<p>
    Second, consider surfaces in $\RR^3$.  Instead of osculating circles, we now have osculating
    ellipsoids (and hyperboloids)!  Thus, the extrinsic curvatures are described by <em>two</em> radii,
    not one.  When considering what is preserved by isometries of a surface, we find that one
    degree of freedom dies (for instance, observe that a plane and cylinder are locally isometric
    because it is possible to roll paper without bending it), and one degree of freedom remains.
    Therefore, even locally, not all surfaces are equivalent!
<p>
    INSERT IMAGE
<p>
    Equipped with this intuitive image of a surface's curvature, several questions become natural:
    Are the aforementioned theorems true?  Is every simply connected constant positive curvature
    manifold a sphere?  What if we allow "small" perturbations away from constant?  Is every
    orientable compact manifold of positive curvature simply connected?  Given curvature
    information, can we relate a compact connected manifold's fundamental group to its metric
    structure?  But we must precisely define curvature before addressing these questions.  We begin
    with a review of manifolds:
<p>
<h5>  $\fbox{SMOOTH MANIFOLDS}$  </h5>
    It is well to define a topological manifold semi-intrinsically as a topological space
    (second-countable and Hausdorff) locally homeomorphic to (open subsets of) some $\RR^n$.  In so
    doing, we rely on a prior notion of general topological structure.  However, we have no
    analogue for general smooth structure.  Thus, we work extrinsically: a <b>smooth manifold</b> of
    dimension $n$ is a family of bijections $\{\phi_i:X_i\to U_i\subseteq \RR^n\}_{i\in I}$ where
    each $U_i\subseteq \RR^n$ is open.  The bijections must obey a gluing axiom: for all
    $i, j\in I$, the map $\phi_i\circ \phi_j|_{\phi_j(X_i\cap X_j)}$ between real open sets is
    <em>smooth</em>.  These "transition maps" will hence be diffeomorphisms and so
    $M = \bigcup_{i\in I} X_i$ will also be a topological manifold (with the second countable and
    Hausdorff assumptions always implicit).  Beware: topological manifolds may have 0, 1, or
    more smooth structures.  Typical examples:
    $S^n, \RR P^n=S^n/(\ZZ/2\ZZ), \CC P^n=S^{2n+1}/U(1)$; Lie Groups such as
    $(S^1)^n, SO(n), SU(n)$; compact surfaces $((S^1)^2)^{\#n}, (\RR P^2)^{\#n}$.
<p>
    DG relies on derivatives, and derivatives act on vectors.  Think of $T_p M$ as a vectorspace of
    velocities.  We recall 3 definitions: derivations of germs; equivalence classes of pointed
    curves; coherent assignments $v_i\in T_{\phi_i(p)U_i}$ of vectors in $T\RR^n$.  The first deals
    with maps $:M\to \RR$; the middle with maps $:\RR\to M$; and the last with local
    diffeomorphisms $M \leftrightarrow \RR^n$ --- each view has contexts of use.  The last
    viewpoint allows us to consider a local (trivial) tangent bundle $\bigsqcup_{p\in V} T_p M$ as
    a smooth manifold itself.  Gluing, we obtain a (nontrivial) bundle $TM \twoheadrightarrow M$
    between smooth manifolds.  $\dim(TM) = 2n$.
<p>
<h5>  $\fbox{METRIC STRUCTURE}$  </h5>
    Finally, metric structure.  We wish to consider metrics $d: M^2\to [0, \infty]$ that agree with
    a manifold's smooth structure.  Specifically, our metrics must: (a) agree with topology; (b)
    have locally smooth squares $d^2|_{U^2}$; and (c) induce <b>length spaces</b>, that is, obey
    $$d(a, b) = \inf_{a=c_0, \cdots, c_m=b} \sum_{0\leq i\lt m} d(c_i, c_{i+1})$$
<p>
    For example, the unit circle $S^1$ has a metric (given by arclength) that obeys the above.  In
    this case, $d^2$ is not globally smooth: it is not differentiable when evaluated at antipodal
    points.  However, $d^2$ is locally smooth.  Moreover, because distance is defined in terms of 
    the length of paths, the length space condition is also met. 
<p>
    INSERT IMAGE
<p>
    This consideration of paths leads us to seek a local characterization of a manifold's metric
    structure.  This is given by the <b>metric tensor</b> $g_p$, a bilinear map on each $T_p M$ defined
    by $2 g_p(v, w) = v(w(q \mapsto d^2(p, q)))$.  The main properties of $g$, to be checked next
    time, are that it is an inner product, that $g_p$ varies suitably smoothly in $p$, and that
    from $g_p$, which gives local geometric information, we can recover $d$ on any connected
    component.
