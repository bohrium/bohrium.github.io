<h3>  Linear Algebra  </h3>
    <em>Who is the average Michigan student $A$?</em>
<p>
    Well, $A$ is 5-and-a-half feet tall and wears a medium T-shirt. This T-shirt is green, a sickly
    mixture of maize and navy that recollects drowned crops; in slightly darker green is printed
    "Michigan Solar Squirrel Ball Volunteer's Club", superposed against a logo of Rorschachian
    ambiguity.  Among the pedestrians and bicyclists of Central Campus, $A$ travels on a unicycle.
    Transportation matters: A's classes are all in the Nichols Arboretum between Central and North.
    In those classes, $A$ always earns a C. Despite this, $A$ sometimes earns As.  $A$ enjoys
    swimming for sport: 10-and-a-quarter laps at the pool, whereupon they find themselves stuck in
    the liquid's middle.  $A$ swims at 1 yard per second but 2 seconds per yard, and at this meager
    pace, still wins 8-contestant races one out of eight times.
<p>
    <b>Exercise</b>: Resolve the mystery of $A$'s speed by constructing an example.  That is, construct
    a set of speeds that average to 1 but whose inverses average to 2.
<p>
    $A$'s story both inspires and warns.  It inspires because it shows that summarization is
    possible: a few statistics can capture something of the flavor of campus life.  Does
    Wikipedia's opening paragraph on the University even compete?  But it also warns us that
    summarization may mislead by neglecting potentially crucial variety and by enabling logical
    contradictions.
<p>
    With this double moral in mind, we note that linear relationships are simple enough to analyze
    but powerful enough to model real data.  Combined with nonlinearities, those relationships
    underlie Machine Learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines, Principal Component
    Analysis, Gaussian Processes, and Neural Networks.  Let's learn how.
<p>
<h4>  Vectors are Data; Covectors are Features </h4>
    In dealing with data, we would like to consider averages and analogies.  For instance, we'd
    like to represent "the average Michigan student" or express that "queen is to woman as king is
    to man".  Those notions are captured by (linear) relations, that is, equations between vectors
    involving only addition and scaling.  For instance, imagine a vector space of concepts.
    Here's a relation that might then hold:
        $$queen − woman = king − man$$
    Later, we’ll introduce more structure, allowing discussion of similarity between vectors and
    hence of generalization.  All these ingredients come together into a language appropriate for
    machine learning.  The language of linear algebra abstracts datapoints as elements of a vector
    space.
<p>
    We now know to represent data as vectors, but this is only half the story. The other half is
    the analysis of that data. Specifically, though we love vectors, we want plain numbers at the
    end of the day. We want meaningful maps $f : \RR \from V$.  Such maps are called features.  For
    instance, recall the queen analogy.  We might study the royalty feature: <tt>queen</tt> has royalty
    level $1$, <tt>woman</tt> has royalty level $0$, and so on.  Crucially, the analogy between concepts
    stays true of their royalty levels: $1 − 0 = 1 − 0$.  It is in this sense that a map
    $f : \RR \from W$ has meaning: it preserves all linear relations, or equivalently, all weighted
    averages.  When a function $f : \RR \from W$ preserves all linear relations, we call it a
    (linear) feature.  Let $W^\star$ denote the set of linear features on $W$.  Then $W^\star$ is
    also a vector space, called the dual of W.
