! Rocks from the Ground Up
!!!! Samuel Tenka, 2020

!! What are Rocks?

    Geology is, of course, the central science: after all, humanity's center of
mass sits firmly within our planet's rocky interior.  These notes explore some
of the amazing phenomena that sculpt the landscapes around us.  We begin by
studying the subatomic constituents of matter; from there, we compose toward
minerals, formations, and continents.
    
!!! (Non-relativistic) fields

    To do geology, we must speak of the %when% and %where% of events.  So let
    us write $\mathcal{S}$ for space-time.  We model each type of subatomic
    particle as a section $\psi$ of some vector bundle $\pi:E\to\mathcal{S}$
    over $\mathcal{S}$.  The Lagrangian density is
    $$
        \bar{\psi} (D - m) \psi
    $$
    for some appropriate differential operator $D$.  Both the fibers and the
    base of the bundle enjoy some important symmetries.
    
!!!! Rotation-symmetry of the base determines the shape of $\psi$

    Our space-time $\mathcal{S}$ enjoys rotation symmetries $SO(3)$.  We insist
    that the Lagrangian density be invariant under rotation; in particular, the
    mass term must be invariant and hence $SU(2)$ must act on the fibers of $E$.
    The fiber $F$ will be some irreducible representation of $SU(2)$ and hence of
    $\mathfrak{so}(3)$.  Let us classify these irreps.  We note that $J_x, J_y, J_z
    \in \mathfrak{so}(3)$ form a basis, where each represents right-handed rotation
    along its associated axis.  Since $x$-rotation swings the $y$-axis toward the
    old $z$-axis, we have $[J_x, J_y]=+J_z$.  In general, $[J_i,J_j]=\epsilon_{ijk}
    J_k$.  For a fixed irreducible representation $V$, $J_z$ has some eigenvector
    $v$ with
    $$
        J_z v = \lambda v
    $$
    We note that
    $$
        J_z (J_x v) = J_x (J_z v) + [J_z, J_x] v 
                    = (\lambda J_x + J_y) v 
    $$
    and likewise
    $$
        J_z (J_y v) = J_y (J_z v) + [J_z, J_y] v 
                    = (\lambda J_y - J_x) v 
    $$
    Therefore,
    $$
        J_z (J_x \pm i J_y) v = (\lambda \mp i ) (J_x \pm i J_y) v 
    $$
    By irreducibility, $J_z$ has an eigenbasis $v_{\lambda + m i}$ indexed by its
    integrally-spaced eigenvalues for $a\leq m \leq b$.  By compactness of $SU(2)$,
    $\lambda$ is imaginary, without loss $0$.  In fact, the most symmetrical
    situation that $a+b=0$ is always true.  Indeed, Let $\boxed{\pm} = (J_x \mp i
    J_y)/\sqrt{2}$ so that
        $[\boxed{+}, \boxed{-}] = i J_z$ and
        $[i J_z, \boxed{\pm}] = \boxed{\pm}$.
    Then one sees by repeated application of those commutators that
    $$
          0
        = \boxed{-} \boxed{+}^{b-a+1} v_{ai}
        = -(b-a+1)(b+a)/2
    $$
    so $a+b=0$.  In particular, we have $-b\leq m \leq b$ integrally spaced for
    $2b$ a non-negative half-integer.  We have thus classified (and constructed)
    all the complex representations of $SU(2)$.  The smallest non-trivial
    representations have $b=1/2$ and $b=1$.  These are inhabited, for instance, 
    by the electron and by the %triplet state% of the heavy Hydrogen nucleus.

!!!! Spinors and vectors: how the Lagrangian density is a (scalar) density

    $SO(3)$ acts on $\mathcal{S}$.  In fact, this action('s complexification) is
    $Hom(\pi_{1/2}, \pi_{1/2})$, which is two-times-two dimensional and splits into
    a one-dimensional $\pi_0$ summand (acting on time) and a three-dimensional
    $\pi_1$ summand (acting on space).
    
    In the case where $\psi$ is a section of $\pi_{1/2}$, we may thus interpret
    the Lagrangian density precise as: 
    $$
        \bar{\psi}_c (\sigma^{c\mu}_{b} D^b_{a\mu} - m I^c_a ) \psi^{a}
    $$
    where $\sigma$ converts from $Hom(\pi_{1/2}, \pi_{1/2})$ to space-time vectors.
    
!!!! Phase-symmetry of the fiber determines the shape of $D$

    The field $\pi_b:E\to \mathcal{S}$ enjoys a connection $\nabla$ that preserves
    magnitudes on the fibers and commutes with the $SU(2)$ action.  The connection
    induces the $D$ that we invoke in the Lagrangian density
    $$
        \bar{\psi} (\sigma D - m) \psi
    $$
    Let us write $D$ more explicitly by comparing it to some trivialization of
    $\pi_b$ (that respects magnitudes and commutes with the $SU(2)$ action). 
    The connection form is a one-form $-i e A$ valued in
    $\mathfrak{u}(2b)$ by norm-preservation and in  
    $i\mathcal{R} = \mathfrak{u}(1) \subseteq \mathfrak{u}(2b)$ because, by
    irreducibility, nothing but phases commutes with the action of $SU(2)$. 
    In short, we may write
    $$
        D^b_{a\mu} = I^b_a (\partial_\mu - i e A_\mu)
    $$
    where $A$ is a real-valued one-form.

    Likewise, the curvature form is a two-form $-i F$ valued in
$\mathfrak{u}(1)$.  In daily life, $\nabla$ is nontrivial in that $F\neq 0$.  

    It is a calculational convenience to choose a trivialization so that we may
write $\nabla$ in terms of $A$, but doing so involves arbitrary choices on
which physics does not depend.  Still, the connection restricted to
topologically nontrivial regions of $\mathcal{S}$ contains more information
than the curvature (due to holonomy), and physics depends on this information
(the *Aharonovâ€“Bohm effect*).  Therefore, $A$ has too much information, $F$
has too little information, and $\nabla$ is just right as a physical model of
the connection. 

    We promote the connection $\nabla$ to a field with its own dynamics.  Using
traditional constants of proportionality, the resulting Lagrangian density is  
    $$
        \mathcal{L} = \bar{\psi} (\sigma D_e - m) \psi - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}
    $$

!!! Quantum particles

    The amplitude to go from a field configuration at time $t$ to another at
time $t^\prime$ is an integral over the space $\mathcal{C}$ of interpolating
field configurations:
    $$
        \int_{\mathcal{C}} \exp\left(-i \int_{\mathcal{S}} \mathcal{L}/\hbar\right) 
    $$
    In the free theory where $e=0$, we may solve exactly.  
    Let us work in momentum space.
