Formalization of Semantics and FILL IN 

A computational mechanism is specified as an endofunctor $S$ on the lattice of ``state predicates'' that preserves
nullary coproducts and finitary nonnullary products.
(Alas, his axioms seem redundant, for he also asks that $S(a) \vee S(b) \leq S(a \vee b)$, which is already implied
by functoriality.)

Biological analysis of programs including Rem's algorithm for online transitive symmetric closure, Tarjan's
algorithm for transitive closure, Knuth's substring matching algorithm, and Prim's minimal spanning tree constructor.
Of these, the last three were discovered by Dijkstra.

Example: find the input's smallest prime factor given only comparisons, addition, and subtraction. 
Dijkstra massages the task specification into a procedure using only $O(\sqrt{n} \log(n) \log\log(n))$ such arithmetic
operations.  One might get comparable performance by implementing multiplication and remainder operations in
$O(\log(a \vee b))^2$ arithmetic operations, then testing divisibility by factors from $2$ through $\sqrt{n}$. 
By trading space for time, Dijkstra improves a $\log$ factor to a $\log \log$ factor, but to overemphasize this would
veil the theme of clear correctness without egregious inefficiency.

Dijkstra writes with wry rhetorical turns, dismissing in absolutist indignance all but his truth and hence often
overstating his case.
