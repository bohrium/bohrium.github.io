    Written in 1962 by Vladimir Nabokov, author of 'Lolita', 
'Pale Fire' stands as a text in 4 parts and 3 layers, with 2-fold symmetry and hidden unity. 
On the surface, the book is not a novel but a poem with thorough annotations. 
The poem, a beautiful meditation on the nature of death by the late John Shade, begins: 
<br><br>
    I was the shadow of the waxwing slain<br>
    By the false azure in the windowpane;<br>
    I was the smudge of ashen fluff---and I<br>
    Lived on, flew on, in the reflected sky.
<br><br>
We see a bird smashing itself against a window that looks like the sky. 
It dies at an invisible boundary between the real and the reflected. 
But the poet imagines that the bird flies on in the reflected space beyond the window. 
Shade continues to depict symmetry between parallel worlds (life and afterlife, the profound and the mundane)
and to examine the shared boundary of each pair.[*] 
<br><br>
    The theme of parallel worlds continues beyond the poem, 
for we soon discover the poem's extensive commentary to be rich itself in plot, symbol, and suspense. 
Indeed, the footnotes to the poem (totaling perhaps 85% of the printed ink) are written by one Dr. Charles Kinbote, 
a harmless but delusional gay vegetarian who reads (really misreads) the poem in increasingly divergent senses.[**] 
Kinbote glosses the poem as a veiled chronicle of a king's exile from the distant nothern state of Zembla
--- and the reader sees that Kinbote believes himself to be that country's king. 
<br><br>
    But as the commentator's self-descriptions become decreasing likely, we search for yet another level of meaning: 
who is Kinbote, truly?  Is he as harmless as he seems?  Where lies the boundary between his myth and Shade's reality
--- if such a boundary exists at all? 
The novel is littered with clues or seeming clues, and I myself have not been satisfied. 
<br><br>
    Perhaps the mystery cannot be resolved.    And perhaps that is the point.    Shade's poem recounts his excitement
upon discovering that his near-death vision of a 'white fountain' had been matched by another's near-death vision of the same, 
only to learn, in disappointment, that the latter had actually forseen a 'white mountain'. 
Nobokov's world is just a little too rich for such a pattern to survive. 
So, as if probing a vector field on a sphere, we can achieve local order in our understanding of the novel's three threads, 
but global consistency seems forever out of reach. 
I like this, for it seems an antidote to my addiction to seeking fundamental pattern. 
Ultimately, there may be no one canonically elegant perspective of Gaussian Distributions --- only many good ones. 
One selects and develops a personal perspective through commentary. 
And as Kinbote decrees: 'for better or worse, it is the commentator who has the last word.'

[*] I recall my own father's fascination with painting frames: 
at the NYC museum of modern art, he tried to learn as much as possible about each painting's frame. 
He values craftsmanship: seamless sleek design, sometimes ornate, sometimes simple. 
A great frame should hide itself and enhance its image --- or should the painting enhance the frame? 
To make it sound profound: he taught me to look for the border between the real and represented.

[**] To the poem's innocent image of a 'male hand', Kinbote adds: 
'... he had nothing on save a leopard-spotted loincloth... 
the boy applied avid lips to a pipe of spring water and wiped his wet hands on his black bathing trunks... 
the young woodwose had now closed his eyes and was stretched out supine on the pool's marble margin...'
