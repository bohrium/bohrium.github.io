As I read Wells' far-future travelogue, I wondered about its construction.  How does one organize a
time-travel story?  The introduction of the time travel idea is an elegant delight, but any
consequent paradoxes are (wisely) left unexplored.  In fact, the author sidesteps issues of tense
and telling via quotes: delimited by atmospheric descriptions of the narrator's late 19th century
present, the plot develops only within that character's narrative.  Wells doesn't show us a time
traveller: he shows us someone who tells of travelling through time.  This distance invites us to
wonder, along with the narrator's audience, at the tale's consistency, truth, and implications.

It is those implications that linger longest in my mind.  To Dr. King's observation that 'the arc
of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice', Wells' narrator might retort that the
the physical universe's arc, even longer, bends toward decay.  Amoral, alien, uncompromising
decay.  Indeed, the novella glides past a near-future blossoming of humanity to consider its
subsequent ruin: humanity's fragmentation, loss of knowledge, and extinction --- and, all the
while, the unpitying ripening of our sun.  It is in thus that the narration ends: grimly, yet with
all the perfect, slow, expansive majesty of Asimov's short story 'The Last Question'.

We might thus end with Wells himself.  My following favorite fragments, sampled and permuted (how
fitting!) from the novella, form a poem:
<br><br>

Night followed day like the flapping of a black wing --- <br> 
the future is still black and blank --- <br>
this bleached, obscene, nocturnal Thing --- <br>
a longing that was pain <br><br>
