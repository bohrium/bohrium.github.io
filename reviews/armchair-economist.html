Economics is fun!  So I've learned from the 'Armchair Economist', a treasury of thought experiments and 
an invitation to puzzle over human behavior.  The book, beginning with the axiom that 'people respond to incentives', 
asks in a multitude of scenarios: based on observed actions, what incentives are present?  based on observed incentives, what actions should follow?

Though the book sparkles with beautiful insights 
(such as Coase's theorem, mechanisms to elicit truthful responses[*], and the presence of bias in certain inflation measurements), 
two chapters are particularly delicious: 'Why Popcorn Costs More at the Movies and Why the Obvious Answer is Wrong' and 'The Iowa Car Crop'.  
The Popcorn chapter introduces a mystery, a solution, objections, counterobjections, countercounterobjections, and so on (I had to ponder it a while); 
it reaches a partially satisfying fixpoint, but its main delights, for me, lie in 
the ideas invoked along the way and the air of possibility we are left with. 
The Iowa chapter, by contrast, presents a gleaming, self-contained argument.

I much appreciate Landsburg's discussion of the urgency and nontriviality of determining our goals.[**] 
As policy makers, we may design incentives to elicit behaviors and hence outcomes, but what outcomes do we seek? 
Landsburg raises this question in 'Telling Right from Wrong', the book's most important chapter. 
He proposes no grand solution, but the question itself is worth asking.  After this chapter, economic efficiency is the 
precisely stated but only approximately accurate answer assumed.

The book closes with ludicrous policy suggestions and a salty complaint about environmentalism. 
I value these for the thought they provoke --- 
for instance, if we condemn the collusion of companies, why do we laud political bipartisanship? 
The analogy intrigues, but it smells fishy.  The question is, whence exactly comes that smell?[***] 
--- but I don't value them very much.

[*] To the book's examples I would add the following: how can one extract a true probability distribution from a reticent meteorologist? 
One wishes to incentivize the reported and true probabilities to be similar; 
however, the rewards can depend only on the reported probabilities and the single actual outcome. 
Answer: use logarithmic rewards!  That is, if the meteorologist says it will rain with chance p, then when it rains, reward her with log(p) dollars, 
and when it doesn't, reward her with log(1-p) dollars.  This is just cross entropy loss in machine learning. 
Speaking of ML, Nihar Shah shows that a multiplicative mechanism for crowdsource labeling is optimal --- see 'Double or Nothing' (JMLR 2016).

[**] I used to walk with a professor --- Igor Markov --- to office hours after his lecture. 
Once, as we ascended a spiral staircase, I remarked to him that it was always better to walk the inner circumference: 
that way, one travels a shorter distance.  He immediately asked me: 'what if I want a workout?'.
