This book is a puzzle wrapped in a travelogue inside software documentation.  
What do I feel upon reading it?  Enchantment.  Possibility.  Creative impulse.  
Dewdney's is a work of world-building; but, unlike Tolkien or Lewis, he invites the reader to join the fun. 
The principles are few: the world is to be as similar as possible to ours, except in 2 space dimensions only. 
From these explode page after page of surprising delights: 
wouldn't creatures with a full-length digestive tract fall apart?  Well, not if they possess zipper(!) mechanism! 
How would one design doors?  Hinges?  Steam engines?  
What would the visual arts be like, burdened and liberated by huge ambiguities of depth and direction? 
On the one-dimensional surface of a disc planet, how would beings accomplish or avoid tasks such as walking past each other? 
And so on...

Reading 'Planiverse' is like living a new life.  One grows accustomed to once-unfamiliar facts of life: 
scaling laws (1D 'surfaces' are unexpectedly small compared to 2D 'volumes'); 
the ease of enclosing a volume and, dually, the difficulty of crossing trajectories, wires, neurons, and other connections;  
and a certain cooperation seemingly necessary of a society all squished together.[*] 
<br><br>
Speaking of scaling laws, one loose thread is Dewdney's treatment of physics in the plane. 
For instance, gravity and electricity are posited to obey a 1/r force law. 
This comes from one reasonable generalization of 3D Newton's 1/r<sup>2</sup> law but not from what to me is the most reasonable generalization. 
Specifically, in d dimensions, Dewdney would expect a 1/r<sup>d-1</sup> law because the force 'spreads out along a sphere'. 
But there is no 'conservation of force' to enforce the force-flux along concentric spheres to agree. 
Why, then, should force 'spread'?  Why should anything 'spread' at all? 
Without recourse to measurement, we prefer to maximize elegance. 
I see most elegance in theories of fields, not forces; these theories suggest an alternate generalization. 
The analysis (for light, not gravity: I know too little about gravity!) might begin with a (2+1)-dimensional potential A<sup>a</sup>, 
differentiation of which yields a 3 x 3 antisymmetric field tensor F<sup>ab</sup>.  
F has 1 magnetic component (a pseudoscalar) and 2 electric components (a vector). 
Next, we write a lagrangian with kinetic term prop to F<sub>ab</sub> F<sup>ab</sup> and source term prop to A<sub>a</sub> J<sup>a</sup>. 
Conservation of charge (d<sub>a</sub> J<sup>a</sup> = 0) implies that --- for any scalar f --- 
(d<sub>a</sub> f) J<sup>a</sup> = d<sub>a</sub> (f J<sup>a</sup>) is a total derivative and thus immaterial. 
We thus recognize a gauge freedom; let us fix a Lorenz(t?) gauge so that d<sub>a</sub> A<sup>a</sup> = 0. 
From this, the Euler Lagrange equations tell us J<sup>b</sup> is prop to d<sub>a</sub> d<sup>a</sup> A<sup>b</sup> - d<sub>a</sub> d<sup>b</sup> A<sup>b</sup> = d<sub>a</sub> d<sup>a</sup> A<sup>b</sup>. 
Thus, we recover light.  
How about time-invariant solutions to a point charge? 
In 2 space dimensions, on the x axis, (x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>)<sup>s/2</sup> has laplacian s(s-1)x<sup>s-2</sup> + s x<sup>s-2</sup>.  
We easily generalize to the result that in d space dimensions, r<sup>s</sup> has laplacian s(s+d-2)r<sup>s-2</sup>.  
For this to vanish away from the origin, we need s=0 or s=2-d.  In 2 dimensions, this means the only time-invariant potentials are constant! 
<strong>Though light is possible, static Coulomb forces are not!</strong>[**] 
I bet developing electromagnetism and Hydrogen in n dimensions would be a great exercise in a chemistry course. 
Alas, I lack time to work this out further[***].

At first, I dismissed others' comparisons between Dewdney's 'Planiverse' and Abbott's 'Flatland'. 
The former is a beautifully detailed tour of a fantastically different life; 
the latter, a silly social critique involving polygons. 
Where the former's earnestness and enthusiasm succeed in absorbing us into a new world, 
the latter's attempt to stir our imaginations, with all its didactic dreariness, falls flat. 
'Planiverse', then, is not only a successor to 'Flatland': it is an upgrade.

[*] Would the USSR have thrived in 2 dimensions?  I imagine a new branch of political theory sensitive to spatial dimension. 
What can engineering tell us about current cultural degrees of freedom?
