"Symbols, Signals, and Noise" is a popular exposition of information theory that alternates most
entertainingly between the viewpoints of birds and frogs.
The author begins with a soaring defense of theory-building;
proceeds to develops a concrete theory of entropy and channel-coding;
rises to speculate on information's role in semantics, physics, computing, psychology, and art;
then returns with final remarks on communication theory proper.
The book's spaciously philosophical quality comes to touch an astonishing diversity of thought, as
the following samples illustrate:
