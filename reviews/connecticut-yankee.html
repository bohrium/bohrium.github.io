I enjoy Twain's delicious novel for its gratifying, indulgent spirit of adventure.
The novel traces its unwitting time traveler, a practical, all-american Hank Morgan, as he
    stumbles into 6th century Arthurian England;
    uses his head-start in education to rise in stature and begin reconstructing the civilization he knows; 
    confronts the there-prevalent blurry mental line between myth and truth;
    enjoys the showmanship of producing ``effects'' to awe the kingdom --- a la Clarke;
    observes and endures the feudal system, leading the reader to consider the exploitation of Twain's compatriots by the rich and white;
    and, challenging the Church, what he identifies as the source of ignorance and oppression, through high-tech revolutionary battle falls. 
Kurt Vonnegut declared that he wrote by tiling tiny jokes together into a larger mosaic.
Twain, too, crafts Hanks journey --- through terror, smugness, frustration, triumph, pity, and heartbreak --- as a
sequence of bitesize pieces, each with a funny or moving punchline. 
Complete with illustrations by Dan Beard (socialist developer of the Boy Scouts of America!), this book would be good
for 45 nightcaps.

Most interesting is Hanks evolving relationship with truth and his inconsistent stance on deception's morality. 
While using his private technical know-how to masquerade as a powerful wizard and thence gain political power, 
Hanks also complains about the ubiquity of superstition and about the Church's stranglehold has on education, common
sense, and culture.  We here see two Hanks: on one hand, a magical sun-destroyer (by luck, he remembered the date of a
solar eclipse), and on the other, an opponent of ignorance, a lone colonist, a civilizer.  Hank hopes to fight fire
with fire; yet, one wonders whether, in his hubris, he might further eclipse those Dark Ages.

Bearing these larger themes are unexpectedly rounded characters, especially Hank's eventual partner Sandy.
Sandy's convoluted, unabstracted, incessant torrents of talk resonate with my own experience (I need to improve at
listening in such situations!).  Though at first seemingly characterized by loquacity and naivity, Sandy shows a deeper
self-awareness in several moments: when she censors her age from conversation, when she apologizes for her lack of
formal education, and when she deploys Hank's reputation as social leverage.  Could her usual qualities but defensively
mask a more vulnerable, knowing character?  Do the subjects of King Arthur, more generally, understand more than they
let on?  

<br><br>
Overall, Twain's text is a feast of individual words, drawing as it does on
Anglo-Saxon language appropriate to Camelot (<tt>cumbrous</tt>, <tt>wattled</tt>, <tt>grub</tt> (verb), <tt>bewray</tt>, <tt>akimbo</tt>, <tt>lubberly</tt>),
slang from the American Gilded Age (<tt>bosh</tt>, <tt>dicker</tt>),
and literary, latinate English (<tt>palliate</tt>, <tt>sluice</tt>, <tt>maunder</tt>).
