I enjoy Twain's delicious novel for its gratifying, indulgent spirit of adventure.  Kurt Vonnegut declared that he 
wrote by tiling small pieces together into a mosaic.  Twain, too, concocts a journey through King Arthur's world in 45
short steps, each with a funny or moving punchline.  This book would be good for 45 nightcaps.  Interestingly, the book 
is (richly!) illustrated by Dan Beard, socialist developer of the Boy Scouts of America.

The novel traces its unwitting time traveler, a practical, engineering-minded, all-american Hank Morgan, as he
    stumbles into 6th century Arthurian England;
    uses his head-start in education to rise in stature and begin reconstructing the civilization he knows; 
    confronts the there-prevalent blurry mental line between myth and truth;
    enjoys the showmanship of producing ``effects'' to awe the kingdom --- a la Clarke;
    observes and endures the feudal system, leading the reader to consider the exploitation of Twain's compatriots by the rich and white;
    and, challenging the Church, what he identifies as the source of ignorance and oppression, through high-tech revolutionary battle falls. 
Hank progresses through terror, smugness, frustration, triumph, pity, and heartbreak.

<br><br>
Most interesting is his evolving and inconsistent relationship with truth and his moral stance on deception. 
Hank at once uses his private technical know-how to masquerade as a powerful wizard and thence gain political power, 
and also complains about the foolishness of the people surrounding him, especially at the stranglehold the Church has
placed on education and common sense.
(e.g. his magical destruction of the sun --- really a lucky remembrance of the pattern of solar eclipses).

Twain's text is a feast of individual words, drawing as it does on Anglo-Saxon language appropriate to Camelot,
slang from the American Gilded Age, and modern literary English.  Its juiciest words tend to be non-latinate --- 
    <tt>lubberly</tt>, 
    <tt>cumbrous</tt>, 
    <tt>scollop</tt>, 
    <tt>wattled</tt>,
    <tt>akimbo</tt>, 
    <tt>dicker</tt>,
    <tt>bosh</tt>,
    <tt>bewray</tt>,
    <tt>grub</tt> (verb),
    <tt>maunder</tt>;
exceptions include
    <tt>palliate</tt> and
    <tt>sluice</tt>.
